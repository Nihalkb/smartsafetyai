a guidebook intended for use by first responders
during the initial phase of a transportation incident
involving hazardous materials/dangerous goods

shipping papers (documents)
for the purpose of this guidebook, shipping documents and shipping papers are 
synonymous. shipping papers provide vital information regarding the hazardous materials/
dangerous goods to initiate protective actions. a consolidated version of the information 
found on shipping papers may be found as follows:
•	
road – kept in the cab of a motor vehicle
•	
rail – kept in possession of a crew member
•	
aviation – kept in possession of the pilot or aircraft employees
•	
marine – kept in a holder on the bridge of a vessel

safety precautions
resist rushing in!
approach cautiously from upwind, uphill and/or upstream:
•	 stay clear of vapor, fumes, smoke and spills.
•	 keep vehicle at a safe distance from the scene.
secure the scene: 
•	 isolate the area and protect yourself and others.
identify the hazards using any of the following:
•	 placards
•	 container labels
•	 shipping papers
•	 rail car and road trailer identification chart
•	 safety data sheets (sds)
•	 knowledge of persons on scene
•	 consult applicable orange guide
assess the situation:
•	 is there a fire, a spill or a leak?
•	 what are the weather conditions?
•	 what is the terrain like?
•	 who/what is at risk:  people, property or the environment?
•	 what actions should be taken – evacuation, shelter-in-place or dike?
•	 what resources (human and equipment) are required?
•	 what can be done immediately?
obtain help:
•	 advise your headquarters to notify responsible agencies and call for assistance from 
qualified personnel.
respond:
•	 enter only when wearing appropriate protective gear. 
•	 rescue attempts and protecting property must be weighed against you becoming 
part of the problem.
•	 establish a command post and lines of communication.
•	 continually reassess the situation and modify response accordingly.
•	 consider safety of people in the immediate area first, including your own safety.
above all: do not assume that gases or vapors are harmless because of lack of a 
smell – odorless gases or vapors may be harmful. use caution when handling empty 
containers because they may still present hazards until they are cleaned and purged of 
all residues.

page 5
notification and request for technical information
follow the steps outlined in your organization’s standard operating procedures and/or local 
emergency response plan for obtaining qualified assistance. generally, the notification 
sequence and requests for technical information beyond what is available in this guidebook 
should occur in the following order:
1.	
notify your organization/agency
•	 based on information provided, this will set in motion a series of events. actions 
may range from dispatching additional trained personnel to the scene, to 
activating the local emergency response plan. 
•	 ensure that local fire and police departments have been notified.
2.	
call the emergency response telephone number on the 
shipping paper
•	 if shipping paper is not available, use guidance under next section “national 
assistance”.
3.	
national assistance
•	 contact the appropriate emergency response agency listed on the inside back cover 
of this guidebook.
•	 provide as much information about the hazardous material/dangerous good and 
the nature of the incident.
•	 the agency will provide immediate advice on handling the early stages of the incident.
•	 the agency will also contact the shipper or manufacturer of the material for more 
detailed information if necessary.
•	 the agency will request on-scene assistance when necessary.
4.	
provide as much of the following information as possible:
•	 your name, call-back telephone number, fax number
•	 location and nature of problem (spill, fire, etc.)
•	 name and identification number of material(s) involved
•	 shipper/consignee/point-of-origin
•	 carrier name, rail car or truck number
•	 container type and size
•	 quantity of material transported/released
•	 local conditions (weather, terrain)
•	 proximity to schools, hospitals, waterways, etc.
•	 injuries and exposures
•	 local emergency services that have been notified

hazard classification system
the hazard class of hazardous materials/dangerous goods is indicated either by its class (or 
division) number or name. placards are used to identify the class or division of a material. 
the hazard class or division number must be displayed in the lower corner of a placard and 
is required for both primary and subsidiary hazard classes and divisions, if applicable. for 
other than class 7 placards, text indicating a hazard (for example, "corrosive") is not 
required. text is shown only in the u.s. the hazard class or division number and subsidiary 
hazard classes or division numbers placed in parentheses (when applicable), must appear 
on the shipping paper after each proper shipping name.

introduction to the table of markings, labels and placards
use this table only when the id number or proper shipping name is 
not available.
this section displays the placards used on transport vehicles carrying hazardous materials/
dangerous goods with the applicable reference guide circled. follow these steps:
1.	
approach scene from upwind, uphill and/or upstream at a safe distance to safely 
identify and/or read the placard or orange panel.  use binoculars if available.
2.	
match the vehicle placard(s) with one of the placards displayed in this section.
3.	
consult the circled guide number associated with the placard.  use that guide 
information for now.  for example:
•	 use guide 127  for a flammable (class 3) placard 
•	 use guide 153  for a corrosive (class 8) placard  
•	 use guide 111  when the danger or dangerous placard is displayed or the
nature of the spilled, leaking or burning material is not known. also use this guide 
when the presence of hazardous materials/dangerous goods is suspected but no 
placards can be seen. 
if multiple placards point to more than one guide, initially use the most conservative 
guide (i.e., the guide requiring the greatest degree of protective actions).
4.	
guides associated with the placards provide the most significant risk and/or 
hazard information.
5.	
when specific information, such as id number or proper shipping name, becomes 
available, the more specific guide recommended for that material must be 
consulted.
6.	
a single asterisk (*) on orange placards represents an explosive's compatibility 
group letter. the asterisk must be replaced with the appropriate compatibility 
group letter. refer to the “glossary” section.
7.	
double asterisks (**) on orange placards represent the division of the explosive. 
the double asterisks must be replaced with the appropriate division number.

rail car identification chart
caution: emergency response personnel must be aware that rail tank cars vary widely in 
construction, fittings and purpose. tank cars could transport products that may be solids, 
liquids or gases. the products may be under pressure. it is essential that products be 
identified by consulting shipping papers or train consist or contacting dispatch centers before 
emergency response is initiated. the information stenciled on the sides or ends of tank cars, 
as illustrated below, may be used to identify the product utilizing:
a.	 the commodity name shown;
b.	 the other information shown, especially reporting marks and car number which, when 
supplied to a dispatch center, will facilitate the identification of the product.
the recommended guides should be considered as last resort if the material cannot 
be identified by any other means.

globally harmonized system of classification 
and labeling of chemicals (ghs)
(may be found on means of containment during transport)
the globally harmonized system of classification and labeling of chemicals (ghs) is an 
international guideline published by the united nations. the ghs aims to harmonize the 
classification and labeling systems for all sectors involved in the life cycle of a chemical 
(production, storage, transport, workplace use, consumer use and presence in the 
environment).
the ghs has nine symbols used to convey specific physical, health and environmental 
hazard information. these symbols are part of a pictogram that is diamond shaped and 
includes the ghs symbol in black on a white background with a red frame. the pictogram 
is part of the ghs label, which also includes the following information:
•	 signal word
•	 hazard statement
•	 precautionary statements
•	 product identifier
•	 supplier identification
ghs pictograms are similar in shape to transport labels; however, transport labels have 
backgrounds of different colors.
the elements of the ghs that address signal words and hazard statements are not 
expected to be adopted in the transport sector. for substances and mixtures covered by 
the un recommendations on the transport of dangerous goods, model regulations, the 
transport labels for physical hazards will have precedence. in transport, a ghs pictogram 
for the same (or lesser) hazard as the one reflected by the transport label or placard should 
not be present, but it could exist on the package.
examples of ghs labeling: 
outer packaging: box with 
flammable liquid transport label
inner packaging: plastic 
bottle with ghs hazard 
warning label
single packaging: 200 l 
(55 us gallons) drum with 
a flammable liquid transport 
label combined with ghs 
hazard warning label

page 17
in some cases, such as on drums or intermediate bulk containers (ibcs), which must 
address information for all sectors, the ghs label may be found in addition to the required 
transport labels and placards.  both types of labels (ghs and transport) will differ in a way 
that will make them easy to identify during an emergency.

hazard identification numbers, utilized under european and some south american regulations, 
may be found in the top half of an orange panel on some intermodal bulk containers. 
the 4-digit id number is in the bottom half of the orange panel.
the hazard identification number in the top half of the orange panel consists of two or 
three digits.  in general, the digits indicate the following hazards:
2 -	 emission of gas due to pressure or to chemical reaction
3 -	 flammability of liquids (vapors) and gases or self-heating liquid
4 -	 flammability of solids or self-heating solid
5 -	 oxidizing (fire-intensifying) effect
6 -	 toxicity or risk of infection
7 -	 radioactivity
8 -	 corrosivity
9 -	 risk of spontaneous violent reaction
note: the risk of spontaneous violent reaction within the meaning of digit 9 includes the 
possibility, due to the nature of a substance, of a risk of explosion, disintegration 
and polymerization reaction followed by the release of considerable heat or 
flammable and/or toxic gases. 
•	
doubling of a digit indicates an intensification of that particular hazard (e.g., 33, 
66, 88).
•	
where the hazard associated with a substance can be adequately indicated by a 
single digit, the digit is followed by a zero (e.g., 30, 40,  50).
•	
a hazard identification number prefixed by the letter “x” indicates that the 
substance will react dangerously with water (e.g., x88).
•	
for the transport of class 1 materials, the hazard identification number will be 
replaced by the explosive’s division number and compatibility group.

pipeline transportation
in north america, hazardous materials/dangerous goods are commonly transported through 
millions of miles of pipelines and related structures. products transported include natural gas, 
natural gas liquids, crude oil, gasoline, diesel fuel, anhydrous ammonia, carbon dioxide, jet 
fuel, and other commodities. although most pipelines are buried, often there are above‑ground 
structures and markers indicating the presence of pipelines. first responders should be 
aware of the pipelines in their jurisdictions, the products they transport, and the operators 
responsible for those pipelines. proactive relationships can be beneficial in the safe and 
effective management of pipeline emergencies.
types of pipelines
natural gas pipelines
natural gas transmission pipelines
large-diameter, steel pipelines transport flammable natural gas (toxic and non-toxic) at 
very high pressures ranging from 200 to 1,500 psi*. natural gas in transmission pipelines is 
odorless — generally not odorized with mercaptan (the “rotten egg” smell); however, natural 
gas containing hydrogen sulfide (h2s) will have a distinct “rotten egg” odor.
natural gas distribution pipelines
natural gas is delivered directly to customers via distribution pipelines. these pipelines are 
typically smaller-diameter, lower-pressure pipelines constructed of steel, plastic, or cast iron. 
natural gas in distribution pipelines is odorized with mercaptan (the “rotten egg” smell).
natural gas-gathering and natural gas well production pipelines
natural gas-gathering/well production pipelines collect “raw” natural gas from wellheads and 
transport the product to gas-processing and/or gas-treating plants. these gathering pipelines 
carry natural gas mixed with some quantity of natural gas liquids, water, and, in some areas, 
contaminants such as toxic hydrogen sulfide (h2s). natural gas in these pipelines is not 
odorized with mercaptan (the “rotten egg” smell); however, natural gas that contains hydrogen 
sulfide (h2s) will have a distinct “rotten egg” odor.
hazardous liquid and highly volatile liquid pipelines
hazardous liquid pipelines
crude oil, refined petroleum products (e.g. gasoline, kerosene, jet fuel or diesel) and hazardous 
liquids (e.g. anhydrous ammonia or ethanol) are often transported by pipelines. 
many liquid petroleum pipelines transport different types of liquid petroleum in the same 
pipeline. to do so, the pipeline operator sends different products in “batches.” for example, 
an operator could send gasoline for several hours, and then switch to jet fuels, before 
switching to diesel fuel.
* data from http://naturalgas.org/naturalgas/transport/

page 23
highly volatile liquid (hvl) pipelines
hvl pipelines transport hazardous liquids which will form a vapor cloud when released to 
the atmosphere and which have a vapor pressure exceeding 276 kpa (40 psia) at 37.8°c 
(100°f). an example of an hvl is liquid propane.
pipeline markers
since pipelines are usually buried underground, pipeline markers are used to indicate their 
presence in an area along the pipeline route. of the three types of pipelines typically buried 
underground — distribution, gathering, and transmission — only transmission pipelines are 
marked with the following above-ground markers used to indicate their route.
markers warn that a transmission pipeline is located in the area, identify the product 
transported in the line, and provide the name and telephone number of the pipeline operator 
to call. markers and warning signs are located at frequent intervals along natural gas and 
liquid transmission pipeline rights-of-way, and are located at prominent points such as where 
pipelines intersect streets, highways, railways, or waterways.
pipeline markers only indicate the presence of a pipeline—they do not indicate the exact 
location of the pipeline. pipeline locations within a right-of-way may vary along its length and 
there may be multiple pipelines located in the same right-of-way.
note: 
•	
markers for pipelines transporting materials containing dangerous levels of hydrogen 
sulfide (h2s) may have markers that say: “sour” or “poison.”
•	
natural gas distribution pipelines are not marked with above-ground signs.
•	
gathering/production pipelines are often not marked with above-ground signs.

page 24
pipeline structures (above ground)
natural gas transmission pipelines: 
compressor stations, valves, metering stations.
natural gas distribution pipelines: 
regulator stations, customer meters and 
regulators, valve box covers.
natural gas gathering/well 
production pipelines: 
compressor stations, valves, metering stations, 
wellheads, piping, manifolds.
petroleum and hazardous 
liquids pipelines: 
storage tanks, valves, pump stations, 
loading racks.
indications of pipeline leaks and ruptures
pipeline releases can range from relatively minor leaks to catastrophic ruptures. it is important 
to remember that gases and liquids behave differently once they are released from a pipeline. 
generally, the following could be indications of a pipeline leak or rupture:
•	
hissing, roaring, or explosive sound
•	
flames appearing from the ground or water (perhaps very large flames)
•	
vapor cloud/fog/mist
•	
dirt/debris/water blowing out of the ground
•	
liquids bubbling up from the ground or bubbling in water
•	
distinctive, unusually strong odor of rotten eggs, mercaptan (an odorant in some 
natural gas pipelines), skunk, or petroleum
•	
discolored/dead vegetation or discolored snow above a pipeline right-of-way
•	
oil slick or sheen on flowing/standing water
•	
an area of frozen ground in the summer
•	
an unusual area of melted snow in the winter

page 25
general considerations for responding to a pipeline emergency
•	
safety first!  your safety and the safety of the community you protect is top priority. 
remember to approach a pipeline incident from upwind, uphill, and upstream while using 
air monitoring equipment to detect for the presence of explosive and/or toxic levels of 
hazardous materials/dangerous goods.
––
always wear proper personal protective equipment. be prepared for a flash fire. use 
shielding to protect first responders in the event of an explosion. use respiratory 
protection.
––
never operate pipeline valves (except in coordination with the pipeline operator); 
this could make the incident worse and put you and others in danger.
––
never attempt to extinguish a pipeline fire before supply is shut off; this could result 
in the accumulation of a large flammable/explosive vapor cloud or liquid pool that 
could make the incident worse and put you and others in danger.
––
do not walk or drive into a vapor cloud in an attempt to identify the product(s) 
involved.
––
do not park over manholes or storm drains.
––
do not approach the scene with vehicles or mechanical equipment until the isolation 
zones have been established (vehicles are a potential ignition source).
•	
secure the site and determine a plan to evacuate or shelter-in-place. work with other 
responders to deny entry to an area.
•	
identify the product and the operator. if safe to do so, you may be able to identify the 
product based on its characteristics or other external clues. look for pipeline markers 
indicating the product, operator of the pipeline, and their emergency contact information. 
pipelines transport many different types of products, including gases, liquids, and highly 
volatile liquids that are in a liquid state inside the pipeline but in a gaseous state if 
released from the pipeline. the vapor density of gases determines if they rise or sink in 
air. viscosity and specific gravity also are important characteristics of hazardous liquids 
to consider. identification of the product also will help you determine the appropriate 
distance for isolation of the affected area.
•	
notify the pipeline operator using the emergency contact information on the pipeline 
marker or other contact information you may have received from the pipeline operator. 
the pipeline operator will be a resource to you in the response.
•	
establish a command post. implement the incident command structure, as needed, 
and be prepared to implement a unified command as additional stakeholders and 
resources arrive.

page 26
other important considerations
•	
if no flames are present, do not introduce ignition sources such as open flames, running 
vehicles, or electrical equipment (cell phones, pagers, two-way radios, lights, garage 
door openers, fans, door bells, etc.).
•	
abandon any equipment used in or near the area of the pipeline release.
•	
if there is no risk to your safety or the safety of others, move far enough away from any 
noise coming from the pipeline to allow for normal conversation.
•	
pipelines often are close to other public utilities, railroads, and highways; these can be 
impacted by pipeline releases or may be potential ignition sources.
•	
natural gas can migrate underground from the source of a release to other areas via the 
path of least resistance (including through sewers, water lines, and geologic formations).
considerations for establishing protective action distances
•	
type of product
––
if you know the material involved, identify the three-digit guide number by looking 
up the name in the alphabetical list (blue section). the relevant guide will provide 
an idea of the risks posed by the material.
•	
pressure and diameter of pipe (the pipeline operator can tell you this if you don’t 
already know it)
•	
timing of valve closure by the pipeline operator (quickly for automated valves; longer 
for manually operated valves)
•	
dissipation time of the product in the pipeline once valves are closed
•	
ability to conduct atmospheric monitoring and/or air sampling
•	
weather (wind direction, etc.)
•	
local variables such as topography, population density, demographics, and fire 
suppression methods available
•	
nearby building construction material/density
•	
natural and man-made barriers (such as highways, railroads, rivers, etc.)

u.s. pipeline resources
u.s. pipeline locations: the national pipeline mapping system (npms) 
https://www.npms.phmsa.dot.gov indicates the general locations of hazardous liquids and 
natural gas transmission pipelines found within the u.s. the pipelines depicted in the npms 
are within 500 feet of their actual locations. emergency responders may apply for an npms 
web viewer account that will allow access to more detailed information than is available to the 
general public. the npms does not contain gathering/production or natural gas distribution 
pipelines.
u.s. pipeline emergency response training: where appropriate, reference pipeline 
emergencies training materials produced by the pipeline and hazardous materials safety 
administration. your state or jurisdiction also may provide training on how to handle the 
response to a pipeline incident.

introduction to yellow section
for entries highlighted in green follow these steps:
•	 if there is no fire:
--
go directly to table 1 (green section)
--
look up the id number and name of material
--
identify initial isolation and protective action distances
--
also consult the appropriate orange guide
•	 if a fire is involved:
--
use the appropriate orange guide for evacuation distances
--
also protect in downwind direction according to table 1 for residual 
material release
note 1:	if the name in table 1 is shown with (when spilled in water), these materials 
produce large amounts of toxic inhalation hazard (tih) (pih in the us) gases 
when spilled in water. some water-reactive materials are also tih materials 
themselves (e.g., un1746 (bromine trifluoride), un1836 (thionyl chloride)). in 
these instances, two entries are provided in table 1 for land-based and water-
based spills. if a water-reactive material only has one entry in table 1 for (when 
spilled in water) and the product is not spilled in water, table 1 and table 2 
do not apply. you will find safe distances in the appropriate orange guide.
note 2:	explosives are not individually listed by their id number because in an emergency 
situation, the response will be based only on the division of the explosive, not on 
the individual explosive.
for divisions 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and 1.5, refer to guide 112.
for divisions 1.4 and 1.6, refer to guide 114.
note 3:	chemical and biological warfare agents are now found in the “criminal or terrorist 
use of chemical, biological and radiological agents” section.

introduction to blue section
for entries highlighted in green follow these steps:
•	 if there is no fire:
--
go directly to table 1 (green section)
--
look up the id number and name of material
--
identify initial isolation and protective action distances
--
also consult the appropriate orange guide
•	 if a fire is involved:
--
use the appropriate orange guide for evacuation distances
--
also protect in downwind direction according to table 1 for residual 
material release
note 1:	if the name in table 1 is shown with (when spilled in water), these materials produce 
large amounts of toxic inhalation hazard (tih) (pih in the us) gases when spilled in 
water. some water-reactive materials are also tih materials themselves (e.g., un1746 
(bromine trifluoride), un1836 (thionyl chloride)). in these instances, two entries are 
provided in table 1 for land-based and water-based spills. if a water-reactive material 
only has one entry in table 1 for (when spilled in water) and the product is not 
spilled in water, table 1 and table 2 do not apply. you will find safe distances in the 
appropriate orange guide.
note 2:	explosives are not individually listed by their name because in an emergency situation, 
the response will be based only on the division of the explosive, not on the individual 
explosive.
for divisions 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and 1.5, refer to guide 112.
for divisions 1.4 and 1.6, refer to guide 114.
note 3:	chemical and biological warfare agents are now found in the “criminal or terrorist 
use of chemical, biological and radiological agents” section.

 guide number and title 
•	 the guide title identifies the general hazards associated with the materials 
in this guide.
 potential hazards 
•	 emergency responders should consult this section first!
•	 describes the material hazard in terms of fire or explosion and health 
effects upon exposure.
•	 the primary potential hazard is listed first. 
•	 allows the responders to make decisions to protect the emergency response 
team, and the surrounding population.

potential hazards
health
• toxic; extremely hazardous.
• may be fatal if inhaled or absorbed through skin.
• initial odor may be irritating or foul and may deaden your sense of smell.
• contact with gas or liquefied gas may cause burns, severe injury and/or frostbite.
• fire will produce irritating, corrosive and/or toxic gases.
• runoff from fire control or dilution water may cause environmental contamination.
fire or explosion
• these materials are extremely flammable.
• may form explosive mixtures with air.
• may be ignited by heat, sparks or flames.
• vapors from liquefied gas are initially heavier than air and spread along ground.
• vapors may travel to source of ignition and flash back.
• those substances designated with a (p) may polymerize explosively when heated or involved in a fire. 
• runoff may create fire or explosion hazard.
• cylinders exposed to fire may vent and release toxic and flammable gas through pressure relief devices.
• containers may explode when heated.
• ruptured cylinders may rocket.
public safety
• call 911. then call emergency response telephone number on shipping paper. if shipping paper 
not available or no answer, refer to appropriate telephone number listed on the inside back cover.
• keep unauthorized personnel away.
• stay upwind, uphill and/or upstream.
• many gases are heavier than air and will spread along the ground and collect in low or confined areas 
(sewers, basements, tanks, etc.).
• ventilate closed spaces before entering, but only if properly trained and equipped.
protective clothing
• wear positive pressure self-contained breathing apparatus (scba).
• wear chemical protective clothing that is specifically recommended by the manufacturer when there is 
no risk of fire.
• structural firefighters' protective clothing provides thermal protection but only limited chemical protection.
evacuation
immediate precautionary measure
• isolate spill or leak area for at least 100 meters (330 feet) in all directions. 
spill
• see table 1 - initial isolation and protective action distances.
fire
• if tank, rail tank car or highway tank is involved in a fire, isolate for 1600 meters (1 mile) in all 
directions; also, consider initial evacuation for 1600 meters (1 mile) in all directions.

emergency response
fire
• do not extinguish a leaking gas fire unless leak can be stopped.
small fire
• dry chemical, co2, water spray or regular foam.
large fire
• water spray, fog or regular foam.
• if it can be done safely, move undamaged containers away from the area around the fire.
• damaged cylinders should be handled only by specialists.
fire involving tanks
• fight fire from maximum distance or use unmanned master stream devices or monitor nozzles.
• cool containers with flooding quantities of water until well after fire is out.
• do not direct water at source of leak or safety devices; icing may occur.
• withdraw immediately in case of rising sound from venting safety devices or discoloration of tank.
• always stay away from tanks in direct contact with flames.
spill or leak
• eliminate all ignition sources (no smoking, flares, sparks or flames) from immediate area.
• all equipment used when handling the product must be grounded.
• do not touch or walk through spilled material.
• stop leak if you can do it without risk.
• use water spray to reduce vapors or divert vapor cloud drift. avoid allowing water runoff to contact spilled 
material.
• do not direct water at spill or source of leak.
• if possible, turn leaking containers so that gas escapes rather than liquid.
• prevent entry into waterways, sewers, basements or confined areas.
• isolate area until gas has dispersed.
• consider igniting spill or leak to eliminate toxic gas concerns.
first aid
refer to the “general first aid” section.
specific first aid:
• in case of contact with liquefied gas, only medical personnel should attempt thawing frosted parts.
• in case of burns, immediately cool affected skin for as long as possible with cold water. do not remove 
clothing if adhering to skin.

 public safety 
•	 this section is divided into three subsections:
››
general information: describes initial precautionary measures to be taken 
by those first on the scene.
››
protective clothing: provides general guidance on personal 
protective equipment requirements including respiratory protection. the 
protective clothing information is general and correct selection is situation 
dependent, after considering the physical and chemical properties of the 
material, weather conditions, spill versus fire, topography, etc. 
››
evacuation: suggests protective distances for immediate precautionary 
measures defined for small and large spills, including suggested guidance 
for conditions where fire is present or likely (potential fragmentation 
hazard).
−−the term “isolate” indicates a zone of no entry that applies to the public 
and first responders who are not equipped, trained, and prepared to 
mitigate the incident.
−−the term “evacuate” aims to protect as many people as possible by 
removing persons from inside a zone safely. if removal is too risky, 
sheltering-in-place can also be considered in this zone.
•	 materials highlighted in green in the yellow and blue sections direct the reader 
to consult table 1, detailing specific response distances for toxic inhalation 
hazard materials and water-reactive materials (green section).
 emergency response 
•	 this section is divided into three subsections: 
››
fire: provides extinguishing procedures for small fire, large fire, and/
or fire involving tanks or car/trailer loads 
››
spill or leak: includes general recommendations, and may describe 
the response procedure for small spill and large spill 
››
first aid: provides specific first aid guidance to use for a product or a 
guide in addition to the general first aid guidance for hazardous materials/
dangerous goods incidents. general first aid guidance is found in the 
“general first aid” section situated immediately after the “how to use the 
orange guides” section.
if a canadian flag appears in this section, and the incident is located in canada, an 
emergency response assistance plan (erap) may be required for this product.

potential hazards
health
•	 radiation presents minimal risk to transport workers, emergency response personnel and the public 
during transportation accidents. packaging durability increases as potential hazard of radioactive content 
increases.
•	 low radiation hazard to people. chemical hazard greatly exceeds radiation hazard.
•	 substance reacts with water and water vapor in air to form toxic and corrosive hydrogen fluoride gas, 
hydrofluoric acid, and an extremely irritating and corrosive, white-colored, water-soluble residue.
•	 toxic; may be fatal if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through skin. 
•	 direct contact with substance and gas may cause burns to skin, eyes, or respiratory tract.
•	 runoff from control of cargo fire may cause low-level pollution.
fire or explosion
•	 substance does not burn.
•	 the material may react violently with fuels.
•	 product will decompose to produce toxic and/or corrosive fumes.
•	 containers in protective overpacks (horizontal cylindrical shape with short legs for tie-downs), are 
identified with af, b(u)f or h(u) on shipping papers or by markings on the overpacks. they are 
designed and evaluated to withstand severe conditions including total engulfment in flames at 
temperatures of 800°c (1475°f) for a period of 30 minutes.
•	 bare filled cylinders, identified with un2978 as part of the marking (may also be marked h(u) or h(m)), 
may rupture in heat of engulfing fire; bare empty (except for residue) cylinders will not rupture in fires.
•	 radioactivity does not change flammability or other properties of materials.
public safety
•	 call 911. then call emergency response telephone number on shipping paper. if shipping paper 
not available or no answer, refer to appropriate telephone number listed on the inside back cover.
•	 priorities for rescue, life-saving, first aid, fire control and other hazards are higher than the 
priority for measuring radiation levels.
•	 radiation authority must be notified of accident conditions. radiation authority is usually responsible for 
decisions about radiological consequences and closure of emergencies.
•	 stay upwind, uphill and/or upstream.
•	 keep unauthorized personnel away.
•	 detain or isolate uninjured persons or equipment suspected to be contaminated; delay decontamination 
and cleanup until instructions are received from radiation authority.

introduction to green tables
table 1 - initial isolation and protective action distances
this table suggests distances useful to protect people from vapors/gases resulting from 
spills involving:
•	 materials that are considered toxic by inhalation (tih) (pih in the us)
•	 materials which produce toxic gases upon contact with water
this table provides first responders with initial guidance until technically qualified emergency 
response personnel are available. for each material, first responders will find distances for 
the following zones:
•	 the initial isolation zone defines an area surrounding the incident in which 
people may be exposed to dangerous (upwind) and life-threatening (downwind) 
concentrations of material.
•	 the protective action zone defines an area downwind from the incident in which 
people may become incapacitated and unable to take protective action and/or incur 
serious or irreversible health effects. table 1 provides specific guidance for small 
and large spills occurring day or night.
adjusting distances for a specific incident involves many interdependent variables. these 
adjustments should only be made by technically qualified personnel. for this reason, no 
precise guidance can be provided in this document to aid in adjusting the table distances; 
however, general guidance follows.
factors that may change the protective action distances
fire
in the orange section, under evacuation – fire, the evacuation distance required to 
protect against fragmentation hazard of a large container is clearly indicated. if involved in a 
fire, the toxic hazard may be less dangerous than the fire or explosion hazard.
in these cases, the fire hazard distance should be used as an isolation distance and table 
1 should be used to protect downwind for residual material release.
worst-case scenario: terrorism, sabotage or catastrophic accident
initial isolation and protective action distances are derived from historical data on 
transportation incidents and the use of statistical models. for worst-case scenarios involving 
the instantaneous release of the entire contents of a package (e.g., as a result of terrorism, 
sabotage or catastrophic accident), the distances may increase substantially.
for such events, doubling the initial isolation and protective action distances is appropriate 
in absence of other information.
when more than one large package is leaking
if more than one rail tank car, highway tank, tank or large cylinder, containing tih materials 
is leaking, large spill distances may need to be increased.

page 281
other factors that can increase the protective action distance:
•	
if a material has a protective action distance of 11.0+ km (7.0+ miles), the actual 
distance can be larger in certain atmospheric conditions.
•	
if the material’s vapor plume is channeled in a valley or between many tall 
buildings, protective action distances may be larger than shown due to less mixing 
of the plume with the atmosphere.
•	
if there is a daytime spill in a region with known strong temperature inversions 
or snow cover, or it occurs near sunset, this may require an increase of the 
protective action distance because airborne contaminants mix and disperse more 
slowly and may travel much farther downwind.
››
in such cases, the nighttime protective action distances may be more 
appropriate.
•	
if the temperature of the liquid spill or the outdoor temperature exceeds 30°c 
(86°f), the protective action distance may be larger.
water-reactive materials
materials that react with water to produce large amounts of toxic gases are included in table 
1. some of these materials have 2 entries in table 1. they are identified by (when spilled 
on land) since they are tih products and (when spilled in water) because they produce 
additional toxic gases when spilled in water. 
choose the larger protective action distance if:
•	
it is not clear whether the spill is on land or in water
•	
the spill occurs both on land and in water
table 2 - water-reactive materials which produce toxic gases
this table lists materials which produce large amounts of toxic inhalation hazard gases 
(tih) when spilled in water as well as the tih gases that are produced.
note: the produced tih gases indicated in table 2 are for information purposes only. 
in table 1, the initial isolation and protective action distances have already taken into 
consideration the produced tih gas.
when a water-reactive tih-producing material is spilled into a river or stream, the source of 
the toxic gas may flow downstream for a great distance.

page 282
table 3 - initial isolation and protective action distances for large 
spills for different quantities of six common tih (pih in the us) gases
this table lists materials that may be more commonly encountered. these materials are:
•	
un1005 - ammonia, anhydrous
•	
un1017 - chlorine
•	
un1040 - ethylene oxide and un1040 - ethylene oxide with nitrogen
•	
un1050 - hydrogen chloride, anhydrous and un2186 - hydrogen chloride, 
refrigerated liquid
•	
un1052 - hydrogen fluoride, anhydrous
•	
un1079 - sulfur dioxide/sulphur dioxide
this table provides initial isolation and protective action distances for large spills (more than 
208 liters or 55 us gallons):
•	
involving different container types (therefore different volume capacities)
•	
for daytime and nighttime situations
•	
for different wind speeds (low, moderate and high)

page 283
protective actions
protective actions are the steps taken to preserve the health and safety of emergency 
responders and the public during an incident involving releases of hazardous materials/
dangerous goods.
table 1 - initial isolation and protective action distances (green section) predicts the size 
of the area that could be affected by a cloud of toxic gas. people in this area should be 
evacuated and/or sheltered-in-place inside buildings.
isolate hazard area and deny entry means to keep everybody away from the area if they are 
not directly involved in emergency response operations. unprotected emergency responders 
should not be allowed to enter the isolation zone.
this "isolation" task is done to establish control over the area of operations. this is the first 
step for any protective actions that may follow.
evacuate means to move all people from a threatened area to a safer place. to perform an 
evacuation, there must be enough time for people to be warned, get ready, and leave an 
area. if there is enough time, evacuation is the best protective action.
begin evacuating people nearby and those who are outdoors in direct view of the scene. 
when additional help arrives, expand the area to be evacuated downwind and crosswind to 
at least the extent recommended in this guidebook.
even after people move to the distances recommended, they may not be completely safe 
from harm. they should not be permitted to gather at such distances. send evacuees to a 
definite place, by a specific route, far enough away so they will not have to relocate again 
if the wind shifts.
shelter-in-place means people should seek shelter inside a building and remain inside 
until the danger passes. it is vital for first responders to maintain communications with 
sheltered-in-place people so that they are advised about changing conditions. 
sheltering-in-place is used either when:
•	
evacuating the public would cause greater risk than staying where they are
•	
an evacuation cannot be safely performed
direct the people inside to:
•	
close all doors and windows
•	
shut off all ventilating, heating and cooling systems
•	
stay far from windows to avoid shattered glass and projectile metal fragments in 
the event of a fire and/or explosion
•	
seal cracks around doors, windows and vents with duct tape or wet cloths
•	
tune in to local media, and remain inside until told it is safe to leave by first 
responders or emergency response authorities
•	
breathe through a wet cloth until an all clear has been communicated
vehicles can offer some protection for a short period if the windows are closed and the 
ventilation systems are shut off. vehicles are not nearly as effective as buildings for in-place 
protection.

page 284
protective action decision factors to consider
the choice of protective actions for a given situation depends on a number of factors. for 
some cases, evacuation may be the best option; in others, sheltering-in-place may be the 
best course. sometimes, these two actions may be used in combination. in any emergency, 
officials need to quickly give the public instructions. the public will need continuing information 
and instructions while being evacuated or sheltered-in-place.
proper evaluation of the factors listed below will determine the effectiveness of evacuation or 
in-place protection (shelter-in-place). the importance of these factors can vary with emergency 
conditions. in specific emergencies, other factors may need to be identified and considered as 
well. this list indicates what kind of information may be needed to make the initial decision.
the hazardous materials/dangerous goods:
•	
degree of health hazard
•	
chemical and physical properties
•	
amount involved
•	
containment/control of release
•	
rate of vapor movement
the population threatened:
•	
location
•	
number of people
•	
time available to evacuate or shelter-in-place
•	
ability to control evacuation or shelter-in-place
•	
building types and availability
•	
special institutions or populations, e.g., nursing homes, hospitals, prisons
the weather conditions:
•	
effect on vapor and cloud movement
•	
potential for change
•	
effect on evacuation or shelter-in-place
note: every hazardous materials/dangerous goods incident is different. each will have 
special problems and concerns. actions to protect the public must be carefully selected. 
this section can help with initial decisions on how to protect the public. officials must 
continue to gather information and monitor the situation until the threat is removed.

page 285
the following table can help to decide if evacuation or sheltering-in-place 
is the best option:
consider evacuation:
consider sheltering-in-place:
vapors are flammable.
vapors are toxic, and people are likely 
to be exposed by evacuating.
buildings cannot be closed tightly.
buildings can be quickly sealed by 
closing all windows and ventilation 
systems, if applicable.
the vapors are continuously generated 
and will hug the ground, or it will take a 
long time for the vapors to clear the area.
the vapors will quickly rise in the air 
column or rapidly dissipate.
for anyone outdoors.
for anyone already indoors.
there are few people to evacuate.
there are too many people to evacuate 
for current available resources.
the threat seems stable but long-
lasting.
circumstances are changing too quickly 
to evacuate safely.

background on table 1 – initial isolation 
and protective action distances
initial isolation and protective action distances in this guidebook were determined for small 
and large spills occurring during day or night. the overall analysis, statistical in nature, was 
conducted using:
•	
state-of-the-art emission rate and dispersion models
•	
statistical release data from the u.s. department of transportation (dot) 
hazardous materials information system (hmis) database
•	
meteorological observations from more than 120 locations in the united states, 
canada, and mexico
•	
the most current toxicological exposure guidelines
for each chemical, thousands of hypothetical releases were modeled to account for the statistical 
variance in both release amount and atmospheric conditions. based on this statistical sample, 
they selected the 90th percentile protective action distance for each chemical and category to 
appear in the table. a brief description of the analysis is provided below.
a detailed report outlining the methodology and data used to generate the initial isolation and 
protective action distances may be obtained from the u.s. dot, pipeline and hazardous 
materials safety administration (phmsa).
description of the analysis
release amounts and emission rates into the atmosphere were statistically modeled 
based on:
•	
data from the u.s. dot hmis database
•	
container types and sizes authorized for transport as specified in 49 cfr §172.101 
and part 173
•	
physical properties of the individual materials
•	
atmospheric data from a historical database
for liquefied gases, which can flash to form both a vapor/aerosol mixture and an evaporating 
pool, the emission model calculated one or both of:
•	
the release of vapor due to evaporation of pools on the ground
•	
direct release of vapors from the container 
the emission model also calculated the emission of toxic vapor by-products generated from 
spilling water-reactive materials in water.
small spills involve 208 liters (55 us gallons) or less. 
large spills involve greater quantities.

page 287
downwind dispersion of the vapor was estimated for each case modeled. using a database 
containing hourly meteorological data from 120 american, canadian, and mexican cities, 
the atmospheric parameters affecting the dispersion and the emission rate were selected.
the dispersion calculation accounted for both the:
•	
time-dependent emission rate from the source
•	
density of the vapor plume (i.e., heavy gas effects)
since atmospheric mixing is less effective at dispersing vapor plumes during nighttime, day 
and night were separated in the analysis.
in the table:
•	
day refers to time periods after sunrise and before sunset
•	
night includes all hours between sunset and sunrise
toxicological short-term exposure guidelines for the materials were applied to determine 
the downwind distance to which people may:
•	
become incapacitated and unable to take protective action
•	
incur serious health effects after a single, or rare, exposure
when available, toxicological exposure guidelines were chosen from aegl-2 or erpg-2 
emergency response guidelines. aegl-2 values were the first choice.
for materials without aegl-2 or erpg-2 values, emergency response guidelines were 
estimated based on lethal concentration limits derived from animal-based-studies. this 
approach was recommended by an independent panel of toxicological experts from industry 
and academia.

how to use table 1 – initial isolation and
protective action distances
(1)	 the responder should already have:
•	
identified the material by its id number and name (if you cannot find an id number, 
use the name of material index in the blue section to find that number);
•	
confirmed that the material is highlighted in green in the yellow or blue section. if 
not, table 1 doesn’t apply;
•	
found the three-digit guide for the material, in order to consult emergency actions 
it recommends along with this table; and
•	
noted the wind direction
(2)	 look in table 1 (green section) for the id number and name of the material involved. 
some id numbers have more than one shipping name listed. look for the specific name 
of the material. if you do not know the shipping name and table 1 lists more than one 
name for the same id number, use the entry with the largest distances.
(3)	 determine if the incident involves a small or large spill and if it is day or night. 
a small spill consists of a release of 208 liters (55 us gallons) or less. this generally 
corresponds to a spill from a single small package (for example, a drum), a small cylinder, 
or a small leak from a large package. a large spill consists of a release of more than 
208 liters (55 us gallons). this usually involves a spill from a large package, or multiple 
spills from many small packages. day is any time after sunrise and before sunset. 
night is any time between sunset and sunrise. 
(4)	 look up the initial isolation distance. 
this distance defines the radius of a zone (initial 
isolation zone) surrounding the spill in all 
directions. in this zone, protective clothing 
and respiratory protection is required. evacuate 
the general public in a direction perpendicular 
to wind direction (crosswind) and away from 
the spill.
(5)	 look up the protective action distance. 
for a given material, spill size, and whether day or night, table 1 gives the downwind 
distance—in kilometers and miles—from the spill or leak source, for which you should 
consider protective actions. for practical purposes, the protective action zone (i.e., 
the area in which people are at risk of harmful exposure) is a square. its length and 
width are the same as the downwind distance shown in table 1. protective actions are 
the steps you take to preserve the health and safety of emergency responders and 
initial isolation

the public. people in this area should be evacuated and/or sheltered-in-place. 
for more information, consult the “protective actions” section.
(6)	 initiate protective actions beginning with those closest to the spill site and working 
away in a downwind direction. when a water-reactive tih (pih in the us) producing 
material is spilled into a river or stream, the source of the toxic gas may move with the 
current or stretch from the spill point downstream for a large distance.
in the figure below, the spill is located at the center of the small black circle. the larger 
circle represents the initial isolation zone around the spill. the square (the protective 
action zone) is the area in which you should take protective actions.
note 1:	 for factors that may change the protective action distances, see the 
"introduction to green tables" section.
note 2:	 when a product in table 1 has the mention (when spilled in water), you 
can refer to table 2 for the list of gases produced when these materials 
are spilled in water. the tih gases indicated in table 2 are for information 
purposes only.
note 3:	 for the instantaneous release of the entire contents of a package (e.g., as a 
result of terrorism, sabotage or catastrophic failure), the distances should 
be doubled.
for more information on the material, safety precautions and mitigation procedures, call 
the emergency response telephone number listed on the shipping paper or the appropriate 
response agency as soon as possible.

see next page for table 2 - water-reactive materials which produce toxic gases

page 334
how to use table 2 – water-reactive materials
which produce toxic gases
table 2 lists materials which produce large amounts of toxic inhalation hazard (tih) (pih 
in the us) gases when spilled in water, and identifies the tih gases produced.
the materials are listed by order of id number.
these water-reactive materials are easily identified in table 1 as their names are
immediately followed by (when spilled in water). 
note 1: 	 the tih gases indicated in table 2 are for information purposes only. in table 
1, the initial isolation and protective action distances have already taken into 
consideration the tih gases produced.
	
for example: table 2 indicates that un1689 sodium cyanide, when spilled 
in water, will generate hydrogen cyanide gas (hcn). in table 1, you must 
refer to the distances for sodium cyanide and not the distances for hydrogen 
cyanide gas.
note 2:	 some water-reactive materials are also tih materials themselves (e.g., un1746 
(bromine trifluoride), un1836 (thionyl chloride)). in these instances, two entries 
are provided in table 1 for land-based and water-based spills. if a water-reactive 
material only has one entry in table 1 for (when spilled in water), and the 
product is not spilled in water, tables 1 and 2 do not apply. refer only to the 
appropriate orange guide.
note 3:	 materials classified as a division 4.3 are substances that, on contact with water, 
are liable to become spontaneously flammable or give off flammable or 
sometimes toxic gases in dangerous quantities. for the purpose of this table, 
water-reactive materials are materials that generate substantial quantities of 
toxic gases rapidly after a spill into water; therefore, a material classified as 
a division 4.3 will not always be included in table 2.

how to use table 3 – initial isolation and protective action 
distances for large spills for different quantities of 
six common tih (pih in the us) gases
table 3 lists toxic inhalation hazard (tih) materials that may be more commonly 
encountered.  
the selected materials are:
•	 un1005 - ammonia, anhydrous
•	 un1017 - chlorine
•	 un1040 - ethylene oxide and un1040 – ethylene oxide with nitrogen
•	 un1050 - hydrogen chloride, anhydrous and un2186 - hydrogen chloride, 
refrigerated liquid
•	 un1052 - hydrogen fluoride, anhydrous
•	 un1079 - sulfur dioxide/sulphur dioxide
the materials are presented in numerical order of id number and provide initial isolation 
and protective action distances for large spills (more than 208 liters or 55 us 
gallons) involving different container types (therefore different volume capacities, see 
below) for day time and night time situations and different wind speeds.
•	 rail tank car: 80 000 kg (176 370 lbs.)
•	 highway tank truck or trailer: 20 000 – 25 000 kg (44 092 – 55 116 lbs.)
•	 agricultural nurse tank: 3785 l (1000 gallons)
•	 small cylinder: 72 l (19 gallons)
•	 ton cylinder: 757 - 1135 l (200 - 300 gallons)

erg2024 user’s guide
for the purposes of this guidebook, the terms hazardous materials/dangerous goods are 
synonymous.
the 2024 emergency response guidebook (erg2024) was developed jointly by transport 
canada (tc), the u.s. department of transportation (dot), and the secretariat of 
infrastructures, communications and transport of mexico (sict), with help from ciquime 
(centro de información química para emergencias) of argentina.
this guidebook is for firefighters, police and other emergency services personnel who may 
be first to arrive at the scene of a transportation incident involving dangerous goods.
it is primarily a guide to help first responders to quickly: 
•	 identify the specific or generic hazards of material(s) involved in a transportation 
incident
•	 protect themselves and the general public during the initial response phase 
of the incident
for the purposes of this guidebook, “initial response phase” is the period after first responders 
arrive at the scene of an incident. during this phase, responders:
•	 confirm the presence and/or identification of dangerous goods
•	 start taking protective action and securing the area
•	 request the help of qualified personnel
this guide is designed for use at a dangerous goods incident on a highway or railroad. it may 
have limited value at fixed-facility locations, or onboard aircrafts or vessels.
this guide does not: 
•	 provide information on the physical or chemical properties of dangerous goods
•	 replace emergency response training, knowledge, or sound judgment
•	 address all possible circumstances that may be associated with a dangerous goods 
incident
erg2024 incorporates dangerous goods lists from the most recent united nations 
recommendations, and from other international and national regulations.
explosives are not listed individually (by either proper shipping name or id number) but, 
under the general heading “explosives”, they do appear:
•	 at the beginning of the id number index (yellow section)
•	 alphabetically in the name of material index (blue section)
chemical and biological warfare agents are now found in the “criminal or terrorist use of 
chemical, biological and radiological agents” section.

page 345
the letter (p) following the guide number in the yellow and blue sections 
identifies materials that present a polymerization hazard under certain conditions. 
for example: un1092 - acrolein, stabilized guide 131p.
first responders at the scene of a dangerous goods incident should not solely rely on this 
guidebook. always seek specific information about any material in question as soon as 
possible. to do so:
•	 contact the appropriate emergency response agency listed on the inside back cover.
•	 call the emergency response telephone number on the shipping paper.
•	 consult information on or accompanying the shipping paper.
before an emergency – become familiar with this guidebook! in the 
u.s., according to the requirements of the u.s. department of labor’s occupational safety 
and health administration (osha, 29 cfr 1910.120) and regulations issued by the u.s. 
environmental protection agency (epa, 40 cfr part 311), first responders must be trained 
in how to use this guidebook.

3- orange section: all safety recommendations are provided here. it is made up of 62 
individual guides. each guide recommends safety and emergency response procedures 
to protect yourself and the public. each guide applies to a group of materials with similar 
chemical and toxicological characteristics. the guide title identifies the general hazards of 
the dangerous goods.
for example:  guide 124 - gases - toxic and/or corrosive - oxidizing.

page 346
each guide is divided into 3 main sections:
potential hazards: 
•	 displays the hazards in terms of fire or explosion and health effects upon 
exposure.
•	 primary potential hazard is listed first.
•	 consult this section first to help you make decisions about how to protect the 
emergency response team and surrounding population.
public safety: 
•	 provides general information on initial precautionary measures to be taken by those 
first on scene.
•	 provides general guidance on protective clothing requirements and respiratory 
protection.
•	 lists suggested evacuation distances for immediate precautionary measures, 
spills, and for fires (fragmentation hazard).
•	 when the material is highlighted in green in the yellow and blue sections, it directs 
the reader to consult table 1, which lists toxic inhalation hazard (tih) (pih in the 
u.s.) materials and water-reactive materials (green section).
emergency response: 
•	 outlines special precautions for incidents that involve fire, spill or leak or 
chemical exposure.
•	 lists several recommendations under each part to further assist your decision-making 
process.
•	 provides specific first aid guidance to use for a product or a guide in addition to the 
general first aid guidance for hazardous materials/dangerous goods incidents. general 
first aid guidance is found in the “general first aid” section situated immediately after 
the “how to use the orange guides” section.
4- green section: this section has 3 tables.
table 1 - initial isolation and protective action distances
lists, by order of id number: 
•	 tih (pih in the u.s.) materials
•	 water-reactive materials which produce toxic gases upon contact with water
these materials are highlighted in green in the yellow and blue sections so you can easily 
identify them.

page 347
table 1 provides two types of recommended safety distances: “initial isolation distances” 
and “protective action distances” for:
•	 small spills: 208 liters (55 us gallons) or less
•	 large spills: more than 208 liters (55 us gallons)
within the “initial isolation distance”, protective clothing and respiratory protection is 
required. you should consider evacuating all people in all directions from the spill or leak 
source. this distance defines the radius of the “initial isolation zone” surrounding the spill in 
which people may be exposed to:
•	 dangerous concentrations upwind of the source
•	 life-threatening concentrations downwind of the source
the “protective action distances” are downwind distances from the spill or leak source, 
within which responders could carry out protective actions to:
•	 preserve the health and safety of emergency responders and the public
•	 evacuate and/or shelter-in-place people in this area (for more information, consult 
the “protective actions” section)
the “protective action distance” is divided into daytime and nighttime incidents because 
varying atmospheric conditions affect a hazardous area’s size. in fact, the quantity or 
concentration of the material’s vapor poses problems, not its mere presence. during the night, 
the air is generally calmer. this causes the vapor to disperse less and therefore creates a 
greater toxic zone. in daytime, the atmosphere is more active, so the vapor disperses more. 
as a result, there is a lower concentration of vapor in the surrounding air and the area that 
reaches toxic levels is smaller. daytime is after sunrise and before sunset. nighttime is 
between sunset and sunrise.
for example, in the case of a small spill of un1955 - compressed gas, toxic, n.o.s., the 
“initial isolation distance” is 150 meters (500 feet); therefore its “initial isolation zone” is 
300 meters (1000 feet) in diameter. its “protective action distance” is 1.0 kilometer (0.6 
miles) for daytime and 3.9 kilometers (2.4 miles) for nighttime.
note 1: some water-reactive materials have 2 entries in table 1. they are identified by 
(when spilled on land) since they are tih products and (when spilled in water) because 
they produce additional toxic gases when spilled in water.
for example: un1746 - bromine trifluoride and un1836 - thionyl chloride.
note 2: if a water-reactive material only has one entry in table 1 for (when spilled in water) 
and the product is not spilled in water, table 1 and table 2 do not apply. you will find safe 
distances in the appropriate orange guide.
for example: un1183 - ethyldichlorosilane and un1898 – acetyl iodide.

page 348
table 2 - water-reactive materials which produce toxic gases 
lists:
•	 by order of id number, materials which produce large amounts of toxic inhalation 
hazard (tih) gases when spilled in water; and
•	 tih gases produced by these materials. 
you can easily identify water-reactive materials in table 1, as their names are immediately 
followed by (when spilled in water).
note: the tih gases indicated in table 2 are for information purposes only. these tih 
gases have already been taken into consideration in the distances of table 1.
for example, table 2 indicates that un1689 sodium cyanide, solid, when spilled in water, 
will generate hydrogen cyanide gas (hcn). in table 1, you must refer to the distances for 
sodium cyanide, solid and not the distances for hydrogen cyanide gas.
table 3 - initial isolation and protective action distances for large spills for different 
quantities of six common tih gases
lists the following 6 most common tih materials:
•	 un1005 - ammonia, anhydrous
•	 un1017 - chlorine
•	 un1040 - ethylene oxide and un1040 - ethylene oxide with nitrogen
•	 un1050 - hydrogen chloride, anhydrous and un2186 - hydrogen chloride, refrigerated 
liquid
•	 un1052 - hydrogen fluoride, anhydrous
•	 un1079 - sulfur dioxide/sulphur dioxide
table 3 shows: 
•	 initial isolation and protective action distances for large spills (more than 208 liters 
or 55 us gallons)
•	 different container types (therefore different volume capacities) for daytime and 
nighttime, and for three different wind speeds (low, moderate and high)

page 349
how to choose the appropriate isolation and protective action 
distances
erg2024 lists isolation or evacuation distances in 2 places:
•	 the individual guides (orange section)
•	 table 1 – initial isolation and protective action distances (green section)
if you are dealing with a non-tih material (not highlighted in green in the yellow or blue 
section),  
•	 go to the assigned guide for the material (orange section).
•	 under evacuation, you will find:
−−initial isolation distance as an immediate precautionary measure
−−specific distances for spill or fire situations (fragmentation hazard)
−−please note that certain guides may also refer to table 1. this is just a reminder 
for green highlighted materials only.
if you are dealing with a tih or water-reactive material (green highlighted entries in the 
yellow or blue section):
if there is no fire: 
•	 go directly to table 1 – initial isolation and protective action distances (green section).
•	 also, consult the assigned guide for the material (orange section).
if a fire is involved:
•	 go directly to the assigned guide (orange section) and apply the distances found 
under evacuation - fire.
•	 also, consult table 1 distances for residual material release.

protective clothing
street clothing and work uniforms
these garments, such as uniforms worn by police and emergency medical services personnel, 
provide almost no protection from the harmful effects of hazardous materials/dangerous goods.
structural firefighters’ protective clothing (sfpc)
this category of clothing, often called turnout or bunker gear, is the protective clothing 
firefighters normally wear during structural firefighting operations. it includes a helmet, coat, 
pants, boots, gloves and a hood to cover parts of the head that are not protected by the helmet 
and facepiece. it can be used with full-facepiece positive pressure self-contained breathing 
apparatus (scba). it should, at minimum, meet the osha fire brigades standard (29 cfr 
1910.156) or nfpa 1851.
structural firefighters’ protective clothing provides limited protection from heat and cold. it 
may not provide adequate protection from harmful vapors or liquids encountered during 
hazardous materials/dangerous goods incidents. 
each guide includes a statement about the use of sfpc in incidents involving the materials 
referenced by that guide. some guides state that sfpc provides limited protection. in those 
cases, the responder wearing sfpc and scba may be able to perform a quick “in-and-out” 
operation. however, this type of operation can place the responder at risk of exposure, injury 
or death. the incident commander makes the decision to do this only if there is an overriding 
benefit (for example, to perform an immediate rescue, turn off a valve to control a leak, etc.). 
please note that the coverall-type protective clothing customarily worn to fight fires in forests or 
wildlands is not sfpc and is not recommended nor referred to elsewhere in this guidebook.
positive pressure self-contained breathing apparatus (scba)
this apparatus provides a constant, positive pressure flow of air within the facepiece. 
you should always use an scba certified by niosh and the department of labor/mine 
safety and health administration, in accordance with:
•	 42 cfr part 84
•	 requirements for respiratory protection specified in osha 29 cfr 1910.134 
(respiratory protection) and/or 29 cfr 1910.156 (f) (fire brigades standard)
•	 nfpa 1852
chemical-cartridge respirators or other filtering masks are not acceptable substitutes for 
positive pressure scba. demand-type scba does not meet the osha 29 cfr 1910.156 
(f)(1)(i) of the fire brigades standard. 
respirators
if you suspect a chemical warfare agent is involved in an incident, use niosh-certified 
respirators with cbrn protection.

page 351
n95 respirators are the most common of the seven types of particulate filtering facepiece 
respirators. this product filters at least 95% of airborne particles (0.3 microns), but is not 
resistant to oil. n95 filtering facepiece respirators do not protect against gases and vapors.
powered air-purifying respirators (papr) force ambient air through the air-purifying cartridge 
or filter into the facepiece. a papr does not supply oxygen or air from a separate source 
(e.g., cylinders).
chemical protective clothing and equipment
for you to safely use this type of protective clothing and equipment, you need specific skills 
developed through training and experience. this type of special clothing may protect against 
one chemical but be readily permeated by chemicals for which it was not designed. therefore, 
do not use this type of protective clothing unless it is compatible with the released material. 
also, be aware that it offers little or no protection against heat and/or cold. 
examples of this type of equipment have been described as:
(1)	 vapor protective suits (nfpa 1991), also known as totally-encapsulating chemical 
protective suits or level a* protection (osha 29 cfr 1910.120, appendix a & b)
(2)	 liquid-splash protective suits (nfpa 1992), also known as level b* or c* protection 
(osha 29 cfr 1910.120, appendix a & b), or suits for chemical/biological terrorism 
incidents (nfpa 1994), class 1, 2 or 3 ensembles and standard can/cgsb/
csa-z1610-11 – protection of first responders from chemical, biological, radiological, 
and nuclear (cbrn) events
no single protective clothing material will protect you from all hazardous materials/dangerous 
goods. do not assume any protective clothing is resistant to cold and/or heat or flame 
exposure, unless certified by the manufacturer (nfpa 1991 5-3 flammability resistance 
test and 5-6 cold temperature performance test).
*consult the glossary for more information about protection levels under the heading 
“protective clothing.”

page 352
decontamination
the ways to decontaminate people and equipment can vary. if you need help with 
decontamination, contact the emergency response telephone number provided on 
the shipping papers or the agencies listed on the inside back cover. these resources 
may be able to put you in contact with the chemical manufacturer to determine the 
appropriate procedure if not otherwise available.
decontamination is the process of removing or neutralizing hazardous materials/dangerous 
goods that have contaminated people and equipment during an incident. 
contamination happens in the area generally referred to as the hot zone. everything and 
everyone entering this zone should be decontaminated when leaving, including emergency 
response personnel. this reduces the chances that more contamination will occur. 
there are two main types of contamination: 
•	 direct contamination happens in the hot zone. 
•	 cross contamination happens when someone or something outside the hot zone 
was not properly decontaminated and comes in contact with another object or person, 
usually in the warm or cold zone. 
to decontaminate, you must:
•	 physically remove contaminants; and/or
•	 chemically neutralize contaminants*.
the nfpa 472, chapter 3, describes the following four kinds of decontamination.
(1)	 gross decontamination: quickly removing surface contamination, which usually 
happens by mechanically removing the contaminant or rinsing with water from 
handheld hose lines, emergency showers, or other nearby water sources.
(2)	 technical decontamination: reducing contamination to a level as low as 
possible by chemical or physical methods. a hazmat team will perform this kind of 
decontamination. 
(3)	 mass decontamination: reducing or removing surface contaminants as fast as 
possible from a large number of people in potentially life-threatening situations.
(4)	 emergency decontamination: immediately reducing contamination of people 
in potentially life-threatening situations with or without formally setting up a 
decontamination corridor. this process should be performed upwind and uphill 
from victims. responders should avoid contact with victims, runoff or spray from the 
decontamination process.
emergency and mass decontamination can be done with firefighting and rescue operations 
equipment. nozzles can be put on wide-angle fog patterns and sprayed towards the ground 
to create a decontamination shower. responders can also place nozzles on the discharge 
ports of engines. 
contaminated clothing and equipment must be removed after use and stored in a controlled 
area (warm zone) until cleanup procedures can begin. sometimes protective clothing and 
equipment cannot be decontaminated and must be disposed of properly.
*chemical neutralization releases heat. do not perform on a victim.

page 353
fire and spill control
fire control
water is the most common and generally most available fire extinguishing agent. use caution 
in selecting a fire extinguishing method, as there are many factors to consider. water may 
be ineffective in fighting fires that involve some materials. 
fires involving a spill of flammable liquids
these fires are usually controlled by applying a firefighting foam to the surface of the burning 
material.
fighting flammable liquid fires requires: 
•	 foam concentrate that is chemically compatible with the burning material
•	 correct mixing of the foam concentrate with water and air
•	 careful application and maintenance of the foam blanket
there are two general types of firefighting foam: regular and alcohol-resistant. examples of 
regular foam are protein-base, fluoroprotein, and aqueous film-forming foam (afff). 
you can control some flammable liquid fires, including many petroleum products, by applying 
regular foam. other flammable liquids, including polar solvents (flammable liquids that are 
water soluble), such as alcohols and ketones, have different chemical properties. you cannot 
easily control a fire that involves these materials with regular foam, and should use alcohol-
resistant foam instead. 
polar solvent fires may be difficult to control and require a higher foam application rate than 
other flammable liquid fires (see nfpa standards 11 for further information). refer to the 
appropriate guide to determine which type of foam to use. for flammable liquids which have 
subsidiary corrosive or toxic hazards, it is difficult to make specific recommendations. however, 
alcohol-resistant foam may be effective for many of these materials. 
contact the emergency response telephone number on the shipping paper, or the appropriate 
emergency response agency, as soon as possible for guidance on the proper fire extinguishing 
agent to use. 
how you decide to control the fire depends on factors such as:
•	 incident location
•	 exposure hazards
•	 size of the fire
•	 environmental concerns
•	 availability of extinguishing agents and equipment at the scene
water-reactive materials
water is sometimes used to flush spills and reduce or direct vapors in spill situations. some 
of the materials covered by this guidebook can react violently or even explosively with water. 
in these cases, consider letting the fire burn or leaving the spill alone (except to prevent its 
spreading by diking) until you can get more technical advice. 

page 354
the applicable guides clearly warn you of these potentially dangerous reactions. technical 
advice is required for these materials since:
•	 water getting inside a ruptured or leaking container may cause an explosion.
•	 you may need to cool adjoining containers with water to prevent them from rupturing 
(exploding), or to prevent the fire spreading further.
•	 water may be effective in mitigating an incident involving a water-reactive material, 
but only if you can apply it at a sufficient flooding rate for a long period.
•	 products from the reaction with water may be more toxic, corrosive or undesirable 
than the product that caused the fire.
when you respond to an incident involving water-reactive materials, take into account:
•	 existing conditions, such as wind, precipitation, location and accessibility to the incident
•	 availability of agents to control the fire or spill
because there are variables to consider, base your decision to use water on fires or spills 
involving water-reactive materials on information from a reliable source. for example, consult 
the material’s manufacturer through the emergency response telephone number or the 
appropriate emergency response agency listed on the inside back cover.
vapor control
limiting the amount of vapor released from a pool of flammable or corrosive liquids is an 
operational concern. it requires proper protective clothing, specialized equipment, appropriate 
chemical agents and skilled personnel. before you engage in vapor control, seek advice on 
tactics to be used from qualified personnel.
there are several ways to minimize the amount of vapors escaping from pools of spilled 
liquids, such as special foams, adsorbing agents, absorbents, and neutralizing agents. to 
be effective, you must select a method for the specific material involved, and use it in a way 
that mitigates, not worsens, the incident.
where specific materials are known, such as at a manufacturing or storage facilities, the 
hazardous materials/dangerous goods response team should prearrange with the facility 
operators to select and stockpile these control agents before a spill.
in the field, first responders may not have the most effective vapor control agent for the material 
available. they will be more likely to have only water, and only one type of firefighting foam 
on their vehicles. if the available foam is not appropriate, they will probably use water spray. 
because water is being used to form a vapor seal, care must be taken not to churn or further 
spread the spill during application. vapors that do not react with water may be directed away 
from the site using the air currents surrounding the water spray. before using water spray 
or other methods to safely control vapor emission or suppress ignition, get technical advice 
based on a specific chemical name.

page 355
liquid spill control
spill control is an important part of any hazardous materials/dangerous goods incident. spills 
can have serious health, safety, and environmental consequences. there are many ways to 
deal with a liquid spill, like:
•	 diking
•	 damming, and
•	 absorbing
a liquid spill can be controlled by setting up a barrier around the spill area. depending on the 
product involved, the spill can be contained with either inert or non-combustible absorbent 
materials.
inert absorbent materials are granular. the most common types are:
•	 sand
•	 diatomaceous earth (a fine powder made from sedimentary rock)
•	 vermiculite, or
•	 clay
non-combustible absorbents are usually not very flammable and can absorb a lot of liquid. 
these materials are usually made from synthetic materials, like:
•	 polypropylene
•	 polyethylene, or
•	 other synthetic fibers
other absorbent materials that are easy to find include sawdust or clay litter. please note 
the following:
•	 sawdust should not be used to absorb flammable liquids or oxidizers since it can 
catch fire
•	 clay litter should not be used to absorb acids since it may contain baking soda, which 
will react with acids
before using an absorbent material, get technical advice to confirm its compatibility or test 
a small amount on the spill.

page 356
considerations for lithium battery and electric vehicle (ev) fires
fire control
water spray cools batteries and helps suppress and slow the release of toxic gases but 
does not stop the chemical reaction (thermal runaway). other extinguishing agents (co2, 
dry chemical, etc.) can trap heat instead of removing it and could result in false (lower 
temperature) readings.
during an electric vehicle (ev) fire, consult the manufacturer’s specific emergency response 
guide for help with identifying high voltage and medium voltage cabling. do not cut 
these cables.
most electric vehicles have emergency cut loops which are low voltage wire loops that can 
be cut to disconnect the high voltage system from the rest of the vehicle. if it is safe to do 
so, follow the manufacturer’s directions to disconnect the 12-volt battery. this will isolate the 
power to the high voltage battery and reduce risk of electric shock.
damaged, defective, or recalled lithium batteries
all lithium batteries can pose a fire risk, whether they are lithium metal or lithium ion, new 
or used. however, damaged, defective, or recalled (ddr) lithium batteries pose a higher 
risk than non-ddr lithium batteries because they are more likely to catch fire in a process 
known as “thermal runaway”.
thermal runaway is a chain reaction that leads to a violent release of stored energy and 
flammable gas. this reaction can spread to other batteries or combustible materials that are 
nearby, which could lead to a large-scale thermal event with severe consequences.
signs that a battery is damaged, defective, or recalled include:
•	 leaking electrolytes
•	 swollen or discolored battery casing
•	 odor or corrosion
•	 burn marks
•	 known conditions of use or misuse
•	 being recalled

bleve and heat induced tear
bleve (boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion)
the following section presents important safety-related information on bleves, including a 
table, to consider in a situation involving liquefied petroleum gases (lpg), un1075.
lpgs include the following flammable gases: 
•	 un1011 - butane
•	 un1077 - propylene
•	 un1012 - butylene
•	 un1969 - isobutane
•	 un1055 - isobutylene
•	 un1978 - propane
a bleve occurs when a fire impinged or damaged tank car fails to contain its internal pressure 
and explodes with a sudden product release. this catastrophic failure is more likely to occur 
with damaged pressure tank cars, even in the absence of an active fire.
the main hazards from a lpg bleve are:
•	 fire: if the released substance is ignited, there is an immediate fireball.
•	 thermal radiation: at a distance of about 4 times the radius of a fireball, the heat 
radiated from a fireball is enough to burn exposed skin in 2 seconds. wearing protective 
clothing limits the thermal radiation dose.
•	 blast: a concussive force caused by the sudden release of the pressurized substance. 
for a bleve occurring out in the open, the blast strength at a distance of 4 times the 
radius of a fireball can break window glass and may cause minor damage to buildings.
•	 projectiles: tank failure can throw metal fragments over large distances. these 
fragments can and have been deadly.
the danger decreases as you move away from the bleve centre. the furthest-reaching 
hazard is projectiles.

https://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/tdg/publications-menu-1238.html. 
heat induced tear (hit)
a heat induced tear (hit) is a rupture of a non-pressure tank car containing flammable 
liquids when exposed to the intense heat of a fire. the metal will soften and the pressure in 
the tank car will increase which can lead to containment failure. the tear generally occurs 
at the vapor space (upper side) of the container, venting large quantities of flammable liquid 
and vapors at high speed. a fireball and an intense heat wave will occur.
compared to bleves, hits rarely result in the projection of tank car fragments. heat induced 
tearing has occurred within 20 minutes of the derailment and as long as 10+ hours following 
the initial fire. 
responding to these types of incidents (bleve and hit) requires specialized training, 
equipment and a tactical approach.

page 358
bleve – safety precautions
use with caution. the following table gives a summary of tank properties, critical times, 
critical distances and cooling water flow rates for various tank sizes.  this table is provided 
to give responders some guidance but it should be used with caution.
tank dimensions are approximate and can vary depending on the tank design and 
application.
minimum time to failure is based on severe torch fire impingement on the vapor space 
of a tank in good condition, and is approximate.  tanks may fail earlier if they are damaged 
or corroded.  tanks may fail minutes or hours later than these minimum times depending 
on the conditions.  it has been assumed here that the tanks are not equipped with thermal 
barriers or water spray cooling.
minimum time to empty is based on an engulfing fire with a properly sized pressure relief 
valve. if the tank is only partially engulfed, then time to empty will increase (i.e., if tank is 50% 
engulfed, then the tanks will take twice as long to empty).  once again, it has been assumed 
that the tank is not equipped with a thermal barrier or water spray.
tanks equipped with thermal barriers or water spray cooling significantly increase the 
times to failure and the times to empty.  a thermal barrier can reduce the heat input to a 
tank by a factor of ten or more.  this means it could take ten times as long to empty the tank 
through the pressure relief valve (prv).
fireball radius and emergency response distance is based on mathematical equations 
and is approximate.  they assume spherical fireballs and this is not always the case.
two safety distances for public evacuation. the minimum distance is based on tanks 
that are launched with a small elevation angle (i.e., a few degrees above horizontal).  this is 
most common for horizontal cylinders.  the preferred evacuation distance has more margin 
of safety since it assumes the tanks are launched at a 45 degree angle to the horizontal.  
this might be more appropriate if a vertical cylinder is involved.
it is understood that these distances are very large and may not be practical in a highly 
populated area.  however, it should be understood that the risks increase rapidly the closer 
you are to a bleve.  keep in mind that the furthest reaching projectiles tend to come off in 
the zones 45 degrees on each side of the tank ends.
water flow rate is based on 5 ( √capacity (usgal) ) = usgal/min needed to cool tank 
metal.
warning: the data given are approximate and should only be used with extreme caution.  
for example, where times are given for tank failure or tank emptying through the pressure 
relief valve – these times are typical but they can vary from situation to situation.  therefore, 
never risk life based on these times.

criminal or terrorist use of chemical, biological and 
radiological agents
if you suspect an intentional release of a chemical, biological or radiological agent (cbrn), 
you should immediately contact your local emergency response authorities (911). additionally, 
for cbrn incidents occurring:
•	 within the united states, call the national response center at 1-800-424-8802
•	 within canada, call canutec at 613-996-6666 (1-888-226-8832)
•	 within mexico, call cenacom at 555128-0000 extensions 36428, 36422, 36469, 
37807, 37810
•	 in other countries, consult the “24-hour emergency response telephone 
numbers” section.” 
the following is general guidance and does not serve as specialized incident response 
training. do not enter the scene without appropriate training and equipment.
initial actions to consider in a potential cbrn/terrorism event:
•	 first responders must ensure their own safety.
•	 avoid using cell phones, radios, etc. within 100 meters (300 feet) of a suspect device.
•	 if known, request trained specialist resources.
•	 set up incident command upwind and uphill of the area.
•	 do not touch or move suspicious packages or containers.
•	 be cautious about the potential presence of secondary devices (e.g., improvised 
explosive devices (ieds)).
•	 avoid contamination.
•	 limit access to only those responsible for rescue of victims or assessment of unknown 
materials or devices.
•	 evacuate and isolate people who were potentially exposed to hazardous materials/
dangerous goods to an area away from the scene, preferably upwind and uphill while 
avoiding physical contact to the extent possible.
•	 isolate contaminated areas and secure the scene for analysis of material.
first responders can use the following information to make an initial assessment of a situation 
they suspect involves criminal or terrorist use of chemical agents, biological agents and/
or radioactive materials (cbrn). to help with this, the following paragraphs have a list of 
observable indicators that a cb agent or radioactive material has been used or is present. 
this section ends with a safe stand-off distance chart for various threats when improvised 
explosive devices (ieds) are involved.
differences between a chemical, biological and radiological agent
chemical and biological agents as well as radioactive materials can be dispersed in the air 
we breathe, the water we drink, or on surfaces we physically contact. dispersion methods 
may be as simple as opening a container or using conventional (garden) spray devices, or 
as elaborate as detonating an improvised explosive device.

page 361
chemical incidents are characterized by the rapid onset of medical symptoms (in minutes 
to hours) and easily observed signatures (colored residue, dead foliage, pungent odor, dead 
insects and animals).
biological incidents are characterized by the onset of symptoms in hours to days. typically, 
there will be no characteristic signatures because biological agents are usually odorless and 
colorless. because of the delayed onset of symptoms, the affected area may be greater due 
to the movement of infected people.
radiological incidents are characterized by the onset of symptoms, if any, in days to weeks 
or longer. typically, there will be no characteristic signatures because radioactive materials 
are usually odorless and colorless. specialized equipment is needed to determine the size of 
the affected area, and if the level of radioactivity is an immediate or long-term health hazard. 
because it is impossible to detect radioactivity without special equipment, the affected area 
may be greater due to the migration of contaminated people. 
the most probable sources would not generate enough radiation to kill people or cause severe 
illness. in a radiological incident generated by a “dirty bomb,” or radiological dispersal device 
(rdd), in which a conventional explosive is detonated to spread radioactive contamination, 
the primary hazard is from the explosion. however, certain radioactive materials dispersed 
in the air could contaminate up to several city blocks, creating fear and possibly panic, and 
needing potentially costly cleanup.
indicators of a possible chemical incident
dead animals/birds/fish
not just an occasional road kill, but numerous animals 
(wild and domestic, small and large), birds, and fish in 
the same area.
lack of insect life
if normal insect activity (ground, air, and/or water) is 
missing, check the ground, water surface or shore line 
for dead insects. if near water, check for dead fish and/
or aquatic birds.
unexplained odors
possible odors include fruity, flowery, sharp, pungent, 
garlic, horseradish-like, bitter almonds, peach kernels, or 
newly mown hay. the odor is completely out of character 
with its surroundings.
unusual numbers of dying or
sick people (mass casualties)
health problems including nausea, disorientation, 
difficulty in breathing, convulsions, localized sweating, 
conjunctivitis (reddening of eyes), erythema (reddening 
of skin) and death.
pattern of casualties
casualties will likely be distributed downwind, or if 
indoors, by the air ventilation system.

page 362
blisters or rashes
numerous people experiencing unexplained water-like 
blisters, weals (like bee stings), and/or rashes.
illness in confined area
different casualty rates for people working indoors versus 
outdoors dependent on where the agent was released.
unusual liquid droplets
numerous surfaces show oily droplets or film; numerous 
water surfaces have an oily film (no recent rain).
different-looking areas
not just a patch of dead weeds, but trees, shrubs, bushes, 
food crops, and/or lawns that are dead, discolored, or 
withered (no current drought).
low-lying clouds
low-lying cloud or fog-like condition not consistent with 
its surroundings.
unusual metal debris
unexplained bomb or munitions-like material, especially 
if it contains a liquid.
indicators of a possible biological incident
unusual numbers of sick or 
dying people or animals
any number of symptoms may occur. casualties may 
occur hours to days after an incident has occurred. 
the time required before symptoms are observed is 
dependent on the agent.
unscheduled and unusual
spray being disseminated
especially if outdoors during periods of darkness.
abandoned spray devices
devices may not have distinct odors.
indicators of a possible radiological incident
radiation symbols
containers may display a “propeller” radiation symbol.
unusual metal debris
unexplained bomb or munitions-like material.
heat-emitting material
material that is hot or seems to emit heat without any 
sign of an external heat source.
glowing material
strongly radioactive material may emit or cause 
radioluminescence.
sick people/animals
in very improbable scenarios there may be unusual 
numbers of sick or dying people or animals. casualties 
may occur hours to days or weeks after an incident 
has occurred. the time required before symptoms are 
observed is dependent on the radioactive material used, 
and the dose received. possible symptoms include skin 
reddening or vomiting.

page 363
personal safety considerations
when you approach a scene that may involve cb agents or radioactive materials, the most 
critical thing to consider is your safety and that of other responders.
use protective clothing and respiratory protection of an appropriate level of safety. in incidents 
where you suspect that cbrn materials have been used as weapons, niosh-certified 
respirators with cbrn protection are highly recommended. be aware that you may not be 
able to verify or identify cb agents or radioactive materials, especially in the case of biological 
or radiological agents.
the following actions apply to a chemical, biological or radiological incident. this guidance 
is general. responders will need to apply it on a case-by-case basis.
approach and response strategies:
•	 minimize exposure time.
•	 maximize the distance between you and the item that is likely to harm you.
•	 use cover as protection.
•	 wear appropriate personal protective equipment and respiratory protection.
•	 identify and estimate the hazard by using the indicators above.
•	 isolate the area and secure the scene.
•	 isolate and decontaminate potentially contaminated people as soon as possible.
•	 to the extent possible, take measures to limit the spread of contamination. 
in the event of a chemical incident, the fading of chemical odors does not necessarily indicate 
reduced vapor concentrations. some chemicals deaden the senses, giving you the false 
perception that the chemical is no longer present.
if there is any indication that an area may be contaminated with radioactive materials, 
including the site of any non-accidental explosion, responders:
•	 should be equipped with radiation detection equipment 
•	 should have adequate training in how to use this equipment
this equipment should be designed to also alert responders when an unacceptable ambient 
dose rate or ambient dose has been reached.

page 364
decontamination measures
for chemical and biological agents: emergency responders should follow standard 
decontamination procedures (flush-strip-flush). mass casualty decontamination should begin 
as soon as possible by stripping all clothing, and flushing with soap and water. for further 
information, contact the agencies listed on the inside back cover of this guidebook.
for people contaminated with radioactive material: take care to minimize the spread 
of the contamination to the extent possible. move them to a low radiation area if necessary, 
and if it can be done safely. remove their clothing and place it in a clearly marked and 
sealed receptacle, such as a plastic bag, for later testing. use decontamination methods 
described above, but avoid breaking the skin (e.g., vigorous brushing). external radiological 
contamination on intact skin rarely causes a high enough dose to be a hazard, to either the 
contaminated individual or the first responders. for this reason, prioritize medical stabilization 
for a contaminated injured individual.
note:	 the above information was developed in part by the department of national defence 
(canada), the u.s. department of the army, aberdeen proving ground and the 
federal bureau of investigation (fbi).
chemical and biological warfare agents 
chemical and biological warfare agents do not have an assigned id number because they 
are not commercially transported. in an emergency situation, the assigned guide (orange 
section) will provide guidance for the initial response.
the volumes used for the chemical warfare agents’ distances are:
•	 small release consists of a discharge up to 2 kg (4.4 lbs.)
•	 large release consists of a discharge up to 25 kg (55 lbs.)
biological warfare agents:
biological agents
pathogens (bacteria, viruses, etc.) that are dispersed 
with criminal intent. they can cause disease or death in 
otherwise healthy humans.
examples: anthrax, plague, smallpox virus.
refer to guide 158.
toxins
poisonous or toxic material from a plant, animal, or 
bacterial source.
examples: botulinum toxin, ricin.
refer to guide 152.

page 365
chemical warfare agents:
blister agents 
(vesicants)
substances that cause blistering of the skin. exposure is 
through liquid or vapor contact with any exposed tissue 
(eyes, skin, lungs).
examples: lewisite, mustard.
symptoms: red eyes, skin irritation, burning of skin, 
blisters, upper respiratory damage, cough, hoarseness. 
blood agents
substances that interfere with cell respiration (the 
exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between blood 
and tissues).
examples: arsine, cyanogen chloride, hydrogen cyanide.
symptoms: respiratory distress, headache, 
unresponsiveness, seizures, coma.
choking agents
substances that cause physical injury to the lungs. 
exposure is through inhalation. in extreme cases, 
membranes swell, and lungs become filled with liquid 
(pulmonary edema). death results from asphyxiation.
examples: diphosgene, phosgene.
symptoms: irritation to eyes, nose, and throat, respiratory 
distress, nausea, vomiting, burning of exposed skin.
incapacitating agents
materials that make people unable to think clearly or 
that cause an altered state of consciousness (possibly 
unconsciousness).
examples: 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate (buzz).
symptoms: hallucinations, confusion, agitation, dilated 
pupils, blurred vision, dry/flushed skin, diarrhea, elevated 
heart rate, high blood pressure, elevated temperature.
nerve agents
substances that interfere with the central nervous system. 
exposure is primarily through contact with the liquid (via 
skin and eyes) and secondarily through inhalation of the 
vapor. 
examples: sarin, tabun, vx.
symptoms: pinpoint pupils, extreme headache, severe 
tightness in the chest, dyspnea, runny nose, coughing, 
salivation, unresponsiveness, seizures.

page 366
tear gas agents
chemical compounds that temporarily make people unable 
to function by causing irritation to the eyes, mouth, throat, 
lungs, and skin.
examples: bromobenzylcyanide, chloroacetophenone.
symptoms: excessive tearing, burning eyes, blurred 
vision, redness of the eyes, burning and irritation to mouth, 
difficulty swallowing, chest tightness, coughing, choking 
sensation, skin burns and rash.
vomiting agents
chemicals that cause rapid onset of irritation of the eyes, 
upper airway, and skin, and also nausea and vomiting.
examples: adamsite, diphenylchloroarsine.
symptoms: irritation of the eyes, noses, burning in throat, 
chest tightness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps.

improvised explosive device (ied)
an ied is a “homemade” bomb and/or destructive device used to destroy, incapacitate, harass, 
or distract. because they are improvised, ieds can come in many forms, ranging from a small 
pipe bomb to a sophisticated device capable of causing massive damage and loss of life.
the following table predicts the damage radius based on the volume or weight of explosive 
(tnt equivalent) and the type of bomb.

glossary
adsorbed gas
a gas which sticks (adsorbs) to the surface of a solid and porous 
material (such as activated charcoal) contained within a metal 
cylinder. this results in an internal cylinder pressure of less than 
101.3 kpa at 20°c (14 psi at 68°f) and less than 300 kpa at 50°c 
(43 psi at 122°f). these pressures are much lower than those of 
conventional cylinders containing compressed or liquefied gases.
aegl(s)
acute exposure guideline level(s), aegls represent threshold 
exposure limits for the general public after a once-in-a-lifetime, 
or rare, exposure and are applicable to emergency exposure 
periods ranging from 10 minutes to 8 hours.  three levels aegl-
1, aegl-2 and aegl-3 are developed for each of five exposure 
periods (10 and 30 minutes, 1 hour, 4 hours, and 8 hours) and 
are distinguished by varying degrees of severity of toxic effects; 
see aegl-1, aegl-2 and aegl-3.
aegl-1
aegl‑1 is the airborne concentration (expressed as parts 
per million or milligrams per cubic meter [ppm or mg/m3]) of a 
substance above which it is predicted that the general population, 
including susceptible individuals, could experience notable 
discomfort, irritation, or certain asymptomatic, non‑sensory 
effects.  however, the effects are not disabling and are transient 
and reversible upon cessation of exposure.
aegl-2
aegl‑2 is the airborne concentration (expressed as ppm or mg/
m3) of a substance above which it is predicted that the general 
population, including susceptible individuals, could experience 
irreversible or other serious, long‑lasting adverse health effects 
or an impaired ability to escape.
aegl-3
aegl‑3 is the airborne concentration (expressed as ppm or mg/
m3) of a substance above which it is predicted that the general 
population, including susceptible individuals, could experience 
life‑threatening health effects or death.
air-reactive
see “pyrophoric”.
alcohol-resistant foam
a foam that is resistant to polar chemicals such as ketones and 
esters which may break down other types of foam.
bleve

flash point
lowest temperature at which a liquid or solid gives off vapor in 
such a concentration that, when the vapor combines with air near

the packing group (pg) is assigned based on the degree of 
danger presented by the hazardous material/dangerous good:
pg i   : great danger
pg ii  : medium danger
pg iii : minor danger
pg
see “packing group”.
ph
ph is a value that represents the acidity or alkalinity of a water 
solution. pure water has a ph of 7. a ph value below 7 indicates 
an acid solution (a ph of 1 is extremely acidic). a ph above 7 
indicates an alkaline solution (a ph of 14 is extremely alkaline). 
acids and alkalies (bases) are commonly referred to as corrosive 
materials.

positive charge while another side has a partial negative charge. 
examples includes alcohols and ketones.
polymerization
a chemical reaction that often produces heat and pressure. 
once initiated, the reaction is accelerated by the heat that it 
produces. the uncontrolled buildup of heat and pressure can 
cause a fire or an explosion, or can rupture closed containers. 
the letter (p) following a guide number in the yellow and blue 
sections identifies a material that may polymerize violently 
under high temperature conditions or contamination with other 
products during a transportation incident. it is also used to identify 
materials that have a strong potential for polymerization in the 
absence of an inhibitor due to depletion of this inhibitor caused 
by accident conditions.
ppm
parts per million. (1 ppm equals 1 ml/m3).

page 376
glossary
protective clothing
in this guidebook, protective clothing includes both respiratory 
and physical protection. one cannot assign a level of protection

(or oxygen).
radiation authority
as referred to in guides 161 through 166 for radioactive 
materials, the radiation authority is either a federal, state/
provincial agency or state/province designated official. the 
responsibilities of this authority include evaluating radiological 
hazard conditions during normal operations and during 
emergencies. if the identity and telephone number of the authority 
are not known by emergency responders, or included in the local 
response plan, the information can be obtained from the agencies 
listed on the inside back cover. they maintain a periodically 
updated list of radiation authorities.

days).

page 377
glossary
self-reactive material
material that is thermally unstable and produces heat upon 
decomposition, even without participation of air.
shelter-in-place
people should seek shelter inside a building and remain inside 
until the danger passes. sheltering-in-place is used when 
evacuating the public would cause greater risk than staying 
where they are, or when an evacuation cannot be performed. 
direct the people inside to close all doors and windows and to 
shut off all ventilating, heating and cooling systems. in-place 
protection (shelter-in-place) may not be the best option if (a) the 
vapors are flammable; (b) if it will take a long time for the gas to 
clear the area; or (c) if buildings cannot be closed tightly. vehicles 
can offer some protection for a short period if the windows are 
closed and the ventilating systems are shut off. vehicles are not 
nearly as effective as buildings for in-place protection.
skin corrosion
the production of irreversible damage to the skin following the 
application of a test substance for up to 4 hours.
skin irritation
the production of reversible damage to the skin following the 
application of a test substance for up to 4 hours.
skin sensitizer
a substance that will induce an allergic response following skin 
contact.
small spill

or less.  this generally corresponds to a spill from a single small 
package (for example, a drum), a small cylinder, or a small leak 
from a large package.
specific gravity
weight of a substance compared to the weight of an equal volume 
of water at a given temperature.  specific gravity less than 1 
indicates a substance is lighter than water; specific gravity greater 
than 1 indicates a substance is heavier than water.
spontaneously 
combustible material
in this guidebook, a spontaneously combustible material means 
a pyrophoric (air-reactive) material or self-heating material. refer 
to each term in the glossary.

page 378
glossary
straight or solid streams method used to apply or distribute water from the end of a 
hose. the water is delivered under pressure for penetration. 
in an efficient stream, approximately 90% of the water passes 
through an imaginary circle 38 cm (15 inches) in diameter at 
the breaking point. hose solid streams are typically created by 
passing water through a non-adjustable bore tip. on the other 
hand, hose straight streams originate from fog nozzles that are 
dialed into a straight stream. hose (solid or straight) streams are 
frequently used to cool tanks and other equipment exposed to 
flammable liquid fires, or for washing burning spills away from 
danger points. however, these streams will cause a spill fire to 
spread if improperly used or when directed into open containers 
of flammable and combustible liquids.
thermal runaway
a chain reaction that leads to a violent release of stored energy 
and flammable gas. this reaction can spread to other batteries 
or combustible materials that are nearby, which could lead to a 
large-scale thermal event with severe consequences.
tih
toxic inhalation hazard. term used to describe gases and 
volatile liquids that are toxic when inhaled (same as pih). these 
materials pose a known hazard to human health during transport 
or is presumed to be toxic to humans because of animal-based 
studies.
v
saturated vapor concentration in air of a material in ml/m3 (ppm) 
at 20°c and standard atmospheric pressure.
vapor density
weight of a volume of pure vapor or gas (with no air present) 
compared to the weight of an equal volume of dry air at the same 
temperature and pressure. a vapor density less than 1 (one) 
indicates that the vapor is lighter than air and will tend to rise. 
a vapor density greater than 1 (one) indicates that the vapor is 
heavier than air and may travel along the ground.
vapor pressure
pressure at which a liquid and its vapor are in equilibrium at a 
given temperature. liquids with high vapor pressures evaporate 
rapidly.
viscosity
measure of a liquid’s internal resistance to flow. this property is 
important because it indicates how fast a material will leak out 
through holes in containers or tanks.

page 379
glossary
warm zone
area between hot and cold zones where personnel and 
equipment decontamination and hot zone support take place. it 
includes control points for the access corridor and thus assists 
in reducing the spread of contamination. also referred to as 
the contamination reduction corridor (crc), contamination 
reduction zone (crz), yellow zone or limited access zone in 
other documents. (epa standard operating safety guidelines, 
osha 29 cfr 1910.120, nfpa 472).
water insoluble
a substance that does not easily dissolve in water.
water-reactive material in this guidebook, a material which produces a large amount of 
toxic gas when it comes in contact with water.
water-sensitive
substances which may produce flammable, toxic and/or corrosive 
decomposition products upon contact with water.
water soluble
a substance that easily dissolves in water. polar substances are 
generally soluble in water.
water spray (fog)
method or way to apply or distribute water. the water is finely 
divided to provide for high heat absorption. water spray patterns 
can range from about 10 to 90 degrees. water spray streams can 
be used to extinguish or control the burning of a fire or to provide 
exposure protection for personnel, equipment, buildings, etc. this 
method can be used to absorb vapors, knock-down vapors 
or disperse vapors. direct a water spray (fog), rather than a 
straight or solid stream, into the vapor cloud to accomplish 
any of the above.
water spray is particularly effective on fires of flammable liquids 
and volatile solids having flash points above 37.8°c (100°f).
regardless of the above, water spray can be used successfully 
on flammable liquids with low flash points. the effectiveness 
depends particularly on the method of application. with proper 
nozzles, even gasoline spill fires of some types have been 
extinguished when coordinated hose lines were used to sweep 
the flames off the surface of the liquid. furthermore, water 
spray carefully applied has frequently been used with success 
in extinguishing fires involving flammable liquids with high flash 
points (or any viscous liquids) by causing frothing to occur only 
on the surface, and this foaming action blankets and extinguishes 
the fire.

emergency response assistance plans (applies in canada only)
an erap or emergency response assistance plan is a transport canada approved plan 
that describes what is to be done in the event of a transportation incident involving certain 
high-risk dangerous goods that require specialized emergency response personnel and 
equipment.
once implemented, a plan can be used to assist local emergency responders either 
remotely or on site, by offering technical and emergency response advice and resources. 
erap resources are often integrated with plans from carriers and local or provincial 
authorities to help mitigate the consequences of an incident.
for shipments that require an erap, an erap reference number and telephone number 
to obtain assistance will be included on the shipping paper. anyone can call the erap 
telephone number. if additional information is required, or to determine if the product 
involved in the emergency requires an erap, contact canutec.
canutec may be called at 1-888-canutec (226-8832) 
or collect at 613-996-6666 (24 hours)

national response center (nrc) 
the nrc, which is operated by the u.s. coast guard, receives reports required when 
hazardous materials are spilled. after receiving notification of an incident, the nrc will 
immediately notify the appropriate federal on-scene coordinator and concerned federal 
agencies. federal law requires that anyone who releases into the environment a reportable 
quantity of a hazardous material (including oil when water is, or may be affected) or a 
material identified as a marine pollutant, must immediately notify the nrc. when in doubt 
as to whether the amount released equals the required reporting levels for these materials, 
the nrc should be notified.
call nrc (24 hours)
