§ 192.3 definitions.
as used in this part:
(2)
pipelines on the outer continental shelf (ocs) that are producer-operated and cross into state
waters without first connecting to a transporting operator's facility on the ocs, upstream (generally
seaward) of the last valve on the last production facility on the ocs. safety equipment protecting
phmsa-regulated pipeline segments is not excluded. producing operators for those pipeline
segments upstream of the last valve of the last production facility on the ocs may petition the
administrator, or designee, for approval to operate under phmsa regulations governing pipeline
design, construction, operation, and maintenance under 49 cfr 190.9;
(3)
pipelines on the outer continental shelf upstream of the point at which operating responsibility
transfers from a producing operator to a transporting operator;
(4)
onshore gathering of gas—
(i)
through a pipeline that operates at less than 0 psig (0 kpa);
(ii)
through a pipeline that is not a regulated onshore gathering line (as determined in § 192.8); and
(iii) within inlets of the gulf of mexico, except for the requirements in § 192.612; or
(5)
any pipeline system that transports only petroleum gas or petroleum gas/air mixtures to—
(i)
fewer than 10 customers, if no portion of the system is located in a public place; or
(ii)
a single customer, if the system is located entirely on the customer's premises (no matter if a
portion of the system is located in a public place).
abandoned means permanently removed from service.
active corrosion means continuing corrosion that, unless controlled, could result in a condition that is
detrimental to public safety.
administrator means the administrator, pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration or his or her
delegate.
alarm means an audible or visible means of indicating to the controller that equipment or processes are outside
operator-defined, safety-related parameters.
close interval survey means a series of closely and properly spaced pipe-to-electrolyte potential measurements
taken over the pipe to assess the adequacy of cathodic protection or to identify locations where a current
may be leaving the pipeline that may cause corrosion and for the purpose of quantifying voltage (ir)
drops other than those across the structure electrolyte boundary, such as when performed as a current
interrupted, depolarized, or native survey.
composite materials means materials used to make pipe or components manufactured with a combination of
either steel and/or plastic and with a reinforcing material to maintain its circumferential or longitudinal
strength.

control room means an operations center staffed by personnel charged with the responsibility for remotely
monitoring and controlling a pipeline facility.
controller means a qualified individual who remotely monitors and controls the safety-related operations of a
pipeline facility via a scada system from a control room, and who has operational authority and
accountability for the remote operational functions of the pipeline facility.
customer meter means the meter that measures the transfer of gas from an operator to a consumer.
distribution center means the initial point where gas enters piping used primarily to deliver gas to customers
who purchase it for consumption, as opposed to customers who purchase it for resale, for example:
(1)
at a metering location;
(2)
a pressure reduction location; or
(3)
where there is a reduction in the volume of gas, such as a lateral off a transmission line.
distribution line means a pipeline other than a gathering or transmission line.
dry gas or dry natural gas means gas above its dew point and without condensed liquids.
electrical survey means a series of closely spaced pipe-to-soil readings over pipelines which are subsequently
analyzed to identify locations where a corrosive current is leaving the pipeline.
engineering critical assessment (eca) means a documented analytical procedure based on fracture mechanics
principles, relevant material properties (mechanical and fracture resistance properties), operating history,
operational environment, in-service degradation, possible failure mechanisms, initial and final defect
sizes, and usage of future operating and maintenance procedures to determine the maximum tolerable

(a)
an operator must use api rp 80 (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7), to determine if an onshore
pipeline (or part of a connected series of pipelines) is an onshore gathering line. the determination is
subject to the limitations listed below. after making this determination, an operator must determine if the
onshore gathering line is a regulated onshore gathering line under paragraph (b) of this section.
(1)
the beginning of gathering, under section 2.2(a)(1) of api rp 80, may not extend beyond the
furthermost downstream point in a production operation as defined in section 2.3 of api rp 80. this
furthermost downstream point does not include equipment that can be used in either production or
transportation, such as separators or dehydrators, unless that equipment is involved in the
processes of “production and preparation for transportation or delivery of hydrocarbon gas” within
the meaning of “production operation.”
(2)
the endpoint of gathering, under section 2.2(a)(1)(a) of api rp 80, may not extend beyond the first
downstream natural gas processing plant, unless the operator can demonstrate, using sound
engineering principles, that gathering extends to a further downstream plant.

commingling of gas from separate production fields, the fields may not be more than 50 miles from
each other, unless the administrator finds a longer separation distance is justified in a particular
case (see 49 cfr § 190.9).
(4)
the endpoint of gathering, under section 2.2(a)(1)(d) of api rp 80, may not extend beyond the
furthermost downstream compressor used to increase gathering line pressure for delivery to
another pipeline.
(5)
for new, replaced, relocated, or otherwise changed gas gathering pipelines installed after may 16,
2022, the endpoint of gathering under sections 2.2(a)(1)(e) and 2.2.1.2.6 of api rp 80 (incorporated
by reference, see § 192.7)—also known as “incidental gathering”—may not be used if the pipeline
terminates 10 or more miles downstream from the furthermost downstream endpoint as defined in
paragraphs 2.2(a)(1)(a) through (a)(1)(d) of api rp 80 (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7) and
this section. if an “incidental gathering” pipeline is 10 miles or more in length, the entire portion of
the pipeline that is designated as an incidental gathering line under 2.2(a)(1)(e) and 2.2.1.2.6 of api
rp 80 shall be classified as a transmission pipeline subject to all applicable regulations in this
chapter for transmission pipelines.
(b)
each operator must determine and maintain for the life of the pipeline records documenting the
methodology by which it calculated the beginning and end points of each onshore gathering pipeline it
operates, as described in the second column of table 1 to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, by:
(1)
november 16, 2022, or before the pipeline is placed into operation, whichever is later; or
(2)
an alternative deadline approved by the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration
(phmsa). the operator must notify phmsa and state or local pipeline safety authorities, as
applicable, no later than 90 days in advance of the deadline in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. the
notification must be made in accordance with § 192.18 and must include the following information:
(i)
description of the affected facilities and operating environment;
(ii)
justification for an alternative compliance deadline; and

(a)
if the nominal wall thickness for steel pipe is not known, it is determined by measuring the thickness of
each piece of pipe at quarter points on one end.
(b)
however, if the pipe is of uniform grade, size, and thickness and there are more than 10 lengths, only 10
percent of the individual lengths, but not less than 10 lengths, need be measured. the thickness of the
lengths that are not measured must be verified by applying a gauge set to the minimum thickness found
by the measurement. the nominal wall thickness to be used in the design formula in § 192.105 is the next
wall thickness found in commercial specifications that is below the average of all the measurements
taken. however, the nominal wall thickness used may not be more than 1.14 times the smallest
measurement taken on pipe less than 20 inches (508 millimeters) in outside diameter, nor more than 1.11
times the smallest measurement taken on pipe 20 inches (508 millimeters) or more in outside diameter.
(a)
except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, the design factor to be used in
the design formula in § 192.105 is determined in accordance with the following table:
(b)
a design factor of 0.60 or less must be used in the design formula in § 192.105 for steel pipe in class 1
locations that:
(1)
crosses the right-of-way of an unimproved public road, without a casing;
(2)
crosses without a casing, or makes a parallel encroachment on, the right-of-way of either a hard
surfaced road, a highway, a public street, or a railroad;
(3)
is supported by a vehicular, pedestrian, railroad, or pipeline bridge; or
(4)
is used in a fabricated assembly, (including separators, mainline valve assemblies, cross-
connections, and river crossing headers) or is used within five pipe diameters in any direction from
the last fitting of a fabricated assembly, other than a transition piece or an elbow used in place of a
pipe bend which is not associated with a fabricated assembly.
(c)
for class 2 locations, a design factor of 0.50, or less, must be used in the design formula in § 192.105 for
uncased steel pipe that crosses the right-of-way of a hard surfaced road, a highway, a public street, or a
railroad.

(3) pipeline segments operating at alternative maop may operate at temperatures
above 120 degrees fahrenheit (49 degrees celsius) if the operator implements a
long-term coating integrity monitoring program. the monitoring program must
include examinations using direct current voltage gradient (dcvg), alternating
current voltage gradient (acvg), or an equivalent method of monitoring coating
integrity. an operator must specify the periodicity at which these examinations occur
and criteria for repairing identified indications. an operator must submit its long-term
coating integrity monitoring program to each phmsa pipeline safety regional office in
which the pipeline is located for review before the pipeline segments may be
operated at temperatures in excess of 120 degrees fahrenheit (49 degrees celsius).
an operator must also notify a state pipeline safety authority when the pipeline is
located in a state where phmsa has an interstate agent agreement, or an intrastate

§ 192.197 control of the pressure of gas delivered from high-pressure distribution systems.
(a)
if the maximum actual operating pressure of the distribution system is 60 p.s.i. (414 kpa) gage, or less
and a service regulator having the following characteristics is used, no other pressure limiting device is
required:
(1)
a regulator capable of reducing distribution line pressure to pressures recommended for household
appliances.
(2)
a single port valve with proper orifice for the maximum gas pressure at the regulator inlet.
(3)
a valve seat made of resilient material designed to withstand abrasion of the gas, impurities in gas,
cutting by the valve, and to resist permanent deformation when it is pressed against the valve port.
(4)
pipe connections to the regulator not exceeding 2 inches (51 millimeters) in diameter.
(5)
a regulator that, under normal operating conditions, is able to regulate the downstream pressure
within the necessary limits of accuracy and to limit the build-up of pressure under no-flow conditions
to prevent a pressure that would cause the unsafe operation of any connected and properly adjusted
gas utilization equipment.
(6)
a self-contained service regulator with no external static or control lines.
(b)
if the maximum actual operating pressure of the distribution system is 60 p.s.i. (414 kpa) gage, or less,
and a service regulator that does not have all of the characteristics listed in paragraph (a) of this section
is used, or if the gas contains materials that seriously interfere with the operation of service regulators,
there must be suitable protective devices to prevent unsafe overpressuring of the customer's appliances
if the service regulator fails.
(c)
if the maximum actual operating pressure of the distribution system exceeds 60 p.s.i. (414 kpa) gage, one
of the following methods must be used to regulate and limit, to the maximum safe value, the pressure of
gas delivered to the customer:
(1)
a service regulator having the characteristics listed in paragraph (a) of this section, and another
regulator located upstream from the service regulator. the upstream regulator may not be set to
maintain a pressure higher than 60 p.s.i. (414 kpa) gage. a device must be installed between the
upstream regulator and the service regulator to limit the pressure on the inlet of the service regulator
to 60 p.s.i. (414 kpa) gage or less in case the upstream regulator fails to function properly. this
device may be either a relief valve or an automatic shutoff that shuts, if the pressure on the inlet of
the service regulator exceeds the set pressure (60 p.s.i. (414 kpa) gage or less), and remains closed
until manually reset.
(2)
a service regulator and a monitoring regulator set to limit, to a maximum safe value, the pressure of
the gas delivered to the customer.
(3)
a service regulator with a relief valve vented to the outside atmosphere, with the relief valve set to
open so that the pressure of gas going to the customer does not exceed a maximum safe value. the
relief valve may either be built into the service regulator or it may be a separate unit installed
downstream from the service regulator. this combination may be used alone only in those cases
where the inlet pressure on the service regulator does not exceed the manufacturer's safe working
pressure rating of the service regulator, and may not be used where the inlet pressure on the service
regulator exceeds 125 p.s.i. (862 kpa) gage. for higher inlet pressures, the methods in paragraph (c)
(1) or (2) of this section must be used.

§ 192.467 external corrosion control: electrical isolation.
(e)
after the initial evaluation required by §§ 192.455(b) and (c) and 192.457(b), each operator must, not less
than every 3 years at intervals not exceeding 39 months, reevaluate its unprotected pipelines and
cathodically protect them in accordance with this subpart in areas in which active corrosion is found. the
operator must determine the areas of active corrosion by electrical survey. however, on distribution lines
and where an electrical survey is impractical on transmission lines, areas of active corrosion may be
determined by other means that include review and analysis of leak repair and inspection records,
corrosion monitoring records, exposed pipe inspection records, and the pipeline environment.
(f)
an operator must determine the extent of the area with inadequate cathodic protection for onshore gas
transmission pipelines where any annual test station reading (pipe-to-soil potential measurement)
indicates cathodic protection levels below the required levels in appendix d to this part.
(1)
gas transmission pipeline operators must investigate and mitigate any non-systemic or location-
specific causes.
(2)
to address systemic causes, an operator must conduct close interval surveys in both directions from
the test station with a low cathodic protection reading at a maximum interval of approximately 5 feet
or less. an operator must conduct close interval surveys unless it is impractical based upon
geographical, technical, or safety reasons. an operator must complete close interval surveys
required by this section with the protective current interrupted unless it is impractical to do so for
technical or safety reasons. an operator must remediate areas with insufficient cathodic protection
levels, or areas where protective current is found to be leaving the pipeline, in accordance with
paragraph (d) of this section. an operator must confirm the restoration of adequate cathodic
protection following the implementation of remedial actions undertaken to mitigate systemic causes
of external corrosion.
(a)
each buried or submerged pipeline must be electrically isolated from other underground metallic
structures, unless the pipeline and the other structures are electrically interconnected and cathodically
protected as a single unit.
(b)
one or more insulating devices must be installed where electrical isolation of a portion of a pipeline is
necessary to facilitate the application of corrosion control.
(c)
except for unprotected copper inserted in ferrous pipe, each pipeline must be electrically isolated from
metallic casings that are a part of the underground system. however, if isolation is not achieved because
it is impractical, other measures must be taken to minimize corrosion of the pipeline inside the casing.
(d)
inspection and electrical tests must be made to assure that electrical isolation is adequate.
(e)
an insulating device may not be installed in an area where a combustible atmosphere is anticipated
unless precautions are taken to prevent arcing.
(f)
where a pipeline is located in close proximity to electrical transmission tower footings, ground cables or
counterpoise, or in other areas where fault currents or unusual risk of lightning may be anticipated, it must
be provided with protection against damage due to fault currents or lightning, and protective measures
must also be taken at insulating devices.

(a)
each test lead wire must be connected to the pipeline so as to remain mechanically secure and
electrically conductive.
(b)
each test lead wire must be attached to the pipeline so as to minimize stress concentration on the pipe.
(c)
each bared test lead wire and bared metallic area at point of connection to the pipeline must be coated
with an electrical insulating material compatible with the pipe coating and the insulation on the wire.
(a)

(c)
for onshore gas transmission pipelines, the program required by paragraph (a) of this section must
include:
(1)
interference surveys for a pipeline system to detect the presence and level of any electrical stray
current. interference surveys must be conducted when potential monitoring indicates a significant
increase in stray current, or when new potential stray current sources are introduced, such as
through co-located pipelines, structures, or high voltage alternating current (hvac) power lines,
including from additional generation, a voltage up-rating, additional lines, new or enlarged power
substations, or new pipelines or other structures;
(2)
analysis of the results of the survey to determine the cause of the interference and whether the level
could cause significant corrosion, impede safe operation, or adversely affect the environment or
public;
(3)
development of a remedial action plan to correct any instances where interference current is greater
than or equal to 100 amps per meter squared alternating current (ac), or if it impedes the safe
operation of a pipeline, or if it may cause a condition that would adversely impact the environment or
the public; and
(4)
application for any necessary permits within 6 months of completing the interference survey that
identified the deficiency. an operator must complete remedial actions promptly, but no later than the
earliest of the following: within 15 months after completing the interference survey that identified the
deficiency; or as soon as practicable, but not to exceed 6 months, after obtaining any necessary
permits.

(a)
corrosive gas may not be transported by pipeline, unless the corrosive effect of the gas on the pipeline
has been investigated and steps have been taken to minimize internal corrosion.
(b)
whenever any pipe is removed from a pipeline for any reason, the internal surface must be inspected for
evidence of corrosion. if internal corrosion is found—
(1)
the adjacent pipe must be investigated to determine the extent of internal corrosion;
(2)
replacement must be made to the extent required by the applicable paragraphs of §§ 192.485,
192.487, or 192.489; and
(3)
steps must be taken to minimize the internal corrosion.
(c)

standard conditions (4 parts per million) may not be stored in pipe-type or bottle-type holders.
(a)
design and construction. except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, each new transmission line
and each replacement of line pipe, valve, fitting, or other line component in a transmission line must have
features incorporated into its design and construction to reduce the risk of internal corrosion. at a
minimum, unless it is impracticable or unnecessary to do so, each new transmission line or replacement
of line pipe, valve, fitting, or other line component in a transmission line must:
(1)
be configured to reduce the risk that liquids will collect in the line;
(2)
have effective liquid removal features whenever the configuration would allow liquids to collect; and
(3)
allow use of devices for monitoring internal corrosion at locations with significant potential for
internal corrosion.
(b)
exceptions to applicability. the design and construction requirements of paragraph (a) of this section do
not apply to the following:

subpart k—uprating
§ 192.551 scope.
this subpart prescribes minimum requirements for increasing maximum allowable operating pressures (uprating)
for pipelines.
(d)
during the test, the temperature of thermoplastic material may not be more than 100 °f (38 °c), or the
temperature at which the material's long-term hydrostatic strength has been determined under the listed
specification, whichever is greater.
(a)
in conducting tests under this subpart, each operator shall insure that every reasonable precaution is
taken to protect its employees and the general public during the testing. whenever the hoop stress of the
segment of the pipeline being tested will exceed 50 percent of smys, the operator shall take all
practicable steps to keep persons not working on the testing operation outside of the testing area until
the pressure is reduced to or below the proposed maximum allowable operating pressure.
(b)
the operator shall insure that the test medium is disposed of in a manner that will minimize damage to
the environment.
(a)
an operator must make, and retain for the useful life of the pipeline, a record of each test performed under
§§ 192.505, 192.506, and 192.507. the record must contain at least the following information:
(1)
the operator's name, the name of the operator's employee responsible for making the test, and the
name of any test company used.
(2)
test medium used.

§ 192.555 uprating to a pressure that will produce a hoop stress of 30 percent or more of smys
in steel pipelines.
(a)
pressure increases. whenever the requirements of this subpart require that an increase in operating
pressure be made in increments, the pressure must be increased gradually, at a rate that can be
controlled, and in accordance with the following:
(1)
at the end of each incremental increase, the pressure must be held constant while the entire
segment of pipeline that is affected is checked for leaks.
(2)
each leak detected must be repaired before a further pressure increase is made, except that a leak
determined not to be potentially hazardous need not be repaired, if it is monitored during the
pressure increase and it does not become potentially hazardous.
(b)
records. each operator who uprates a segment of pipeline shall retain for the life of the segment a record
of each investigation required by this subpart, of all work performed, and of each pressure test conducted,
in connection with the uprating.
(c)
written plan. each operator who uprates a segment of pipeline shall establish a written procedure that will
ensure that each applicable requirement of this subpart is complied with.
(d)
limitation on increase in maximum allowable operating pressure. except as provided in § 192.555(c), a
new maximum allowable operating pressure established under this subpart may not exceed the
maximum that would be allowed under §§ 192.619 and 192.621 for a new segment of pipeline
constructed of the same materials in the same location. however, when uprating a steel pipeline, if any
variable necessary to determine the design pressure under the design formula (§ 192.105) is unknown,
the maop may be increased as provided in § 192.619(a)(1).
(a)
unless the requirements of this section have been met, no person may subject any segment of a steel
pipeline to an operating pressure that will produce a hoop stress of 30 percent or more of smys and that
is above the established maximum allowable operating pressure.
(b)
before increasing operating pressure above the previously established maximum allowable operating
pressure the operator shall:
(1)
review the design, operating, and maintenance history and previous testing of the segment of
pipeline and determine whether the proposed increase is safe and consistent with the requirements
of this part; and
(2)
make any repairs, replacements, or alterations in the segment of pipeline that are necessary for safe
operation at the increased pressure.
(c)
after complying with paragraph (b) of this section, an operator may increase the maximum allowable
operating pressure of a segment of pipeline constructed before september 12, 1970, to the highest
pressure that is permitted under § 192.619, using as test pressure the highest pressure to which the
segment of pipeline was previously subjected (either in a strength test or in actual operation).

§ 192.557 uprating: steel pipelines to a pressure that will produce a hoop stress less than 30
percent of smys: plastic, cast iron, and ductile iron pipelines.
(d)
after complying with paragraph (b) of this section, an operator that does not qualify under paragraph (c)
of this section may increase the previously established maximum allowable operating pressure if at least
one of the following requirements is met:
(1)
the segment of pipeline is successfully tested in accordance with the requirements of this part for a
new line of the same material in the same location.
(2)
an increased maximum allowable operating pressure may be established for a segment of pipeline
in a class 1 location if the line has not previously been tested, and if:
(i)
it is impractical to test it in accordance with the requirements of this part;
(ii)
the new maximum operating pressure does not exceed 80 percent of that allowed for a new
line of the same design in the same location; and
(iii) the operator determines that the new maximum allowable operating pressure is consistent
with the condition of the segment of pipeline and the design requirements of this part.
(e)
where a segment of pipeline is uprated in accordance with paragraph (c) or (d)(2) of this section, the
increase in pressure must be made in increments that are equal to:
(1)
10 percent of the pressure before the uprating; or
(2)
25 percent of the total pressure increase,
(a)
unless the requirements of this section have been met, no person may subject:
(1)
a segment of steel pipeline to an operating pressure that will produce a hoop stress less than 30
percent of smys and that is above the previously established maximum allowable operating
pressure; or
(2)
a plastic, cast iron, or ductile iron pipeline segment to an operating pressure that is above the
previously established maximum allowable operating pressure.
(b)
before increasing operating pressure above the previously established maximum allowable operating
pressure, the operator shall:
(1)
review the design, operating, and maintenance history of the segment of pipeline;
(2)
make a leakage survey (if it has been more than 1 year since the last survey) and repair any leaks
that are found, except that a leak determined not to be potentially hazardous need not be repaired, if
it is monitored during the pressure increase and it does not become potentially hazardous;
(3)
make any repairs, replacements, or alterations in the segment of pipeline that are necessary for safe
operation at the increased pressure;
(4)
reinforce or anchor offsets, bends and dead ends in pipe joined by compression couplings or bell
and spigot joints to prevent failure of the pipe joint, if the offset, bend, or dead end is exposed in an
excavation;

if the pressure in mains or service lines, or both, is to be higher than the pressure delivered to the
customer, install a service regulator on each service line and test each regulator to determine that it
is functioning. pressure may be increased as necessary to test each regulator, after a regulator has
been installed on each pipeline subject to the increased pressure.
(c)
after complying with paragraph (b) of this section, the increase in maximum allowable operating pressure
must be made in increments that are equal to 10 p.s.i. (69 kpa) gage or 25 percent of the total pressure
increase, whichever produces the fewer number of increments. whenever the requirements of paragraph
(b)(6) of this section apply, there must be at least two approximately equal incremental increases.
(d)
if records for cast iron or ductile iron pipeline facilities are not complete enough to determine stresses
produced by internal pressure, trench loading, rolling loads, beam stresses, and other bending loads, in
evaluating the level of safety of the pipeline when operating at the proposed increased pressure, the
following procedures must be followed:
(1)
in estimating the stresses, if the original laying conditions cannot be ascertained, the operator shall
assume that cast iron pipe was supported on blocks with tamped backfill and that ductile iron pipe
was laid without blocks with tamped backfill.
(2)
unless the actual maximum cover depth is known, the operator shall measure the actual cover in at
least three places where the cover is most likely to be greatest and shall use the greatest cover
measured.
(3)
unless the actual nominal wall thickness is known, the operator shall determine the wall thickness by
cutting and measuring coupons from at least three separate pipe lengths. the coupons must be cut
from pipe lengths in areas where the cover depth is most likely to be the greatest. the average of all
measurements taken must be increased by the allowance indicated in the following table:
(4)
for cast iron pipe, unless the pipe manufacturing process is known, the operator shall assume that
the pipe is pit cast pipe with a bursting tensile strength of 11,000 p.s.i. (76 mpa) gage and a
modulus of rupture of 31,000 p.s.i. (214 mpa) gage.

transmission pipelines.
(d)
safety-related condition reports. the manual required by paragraph (a) of this section must include
instructions enabling personnel who perform operation and maintenance activities to recognize
conditions that potentially may be safety-related conditions that are subject to the reporting requirements
of § 191.23 of this subchapter.
(e)
surveillance, emergency response, and accident investigation. the procedures required by §§ 192.613(a),
192.615, and 192.617 must be included in the manual required by paragraph (a) of this section.
(a)
applicability. wherever required by this part, operators of onshore steel transmission pipelines must
document and verify material properties and attributes in accordance with this section.
(b)
documentation of material properties and attributes. records established under this section documenting
physical pipeline characteristics and attributes, including diameter, wall thickness, seam type, and grade
(e.g., yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, or pressure rating for valves and flanges, etc.), must be
maintained for the life of the pipeline and be traceable, verifiable, and complete. charpy v-notch
toughness values established under this section needed to meet the requirements of the eca method at
§ 192.624(c)(3) or the fracture mechanics requirements at § 192.712 must be maintained for the life of
the pipeline.
(c)
verification of material properties and attributes. if an operator does not have traceable, verifiable, and
complete records required by paragraph (b) of this section, the operator must develop and implement
procedures for conducting nondestructive or destructive tests, examinations, and assessments in order
to verify the material properties of aboveground line pipe and components, and of buried line pipe and
components when excavations occur at the following opportunities: anomaly direct examinations, in situ
evaluations, repairs, remediations, maintenance, and excavations that are associated with replacements
or relocations of pipeline segments that are removed from service. the procedures must also provide for
the following:
(1)
for nondestructive tests, at each test location, material properties for minimum yield strength and

strength and ultimate tensile strength must be conducted on each test pipe cylinder removed from
each location, in accordance with api specification 5l.
(3)
tests, examinations, and assessments must be appropriate for verifying the necessary material
properties and attributes.
(4)
if toughness properties are not documented, the procedures must include accepted industry
methods for verifying pipe material toughness.
(5)
verification of material properties and attributes for non-line pipe components must comply with
paragraph (f) of this section.

(d)
special requirements for nondestructive methods. procedures developed in accordance with paragraph (c)
of this section for verification of material properties and attributes using nondestructive methods must:
(1)
use methods, tools, procedures, and techniques that have been validated by a subject matter expert
based on comparison with destructive test results on material of comparable grade and vintage;
(2)
conservatively account for measurement inaccuracy and uncertainty using reliable engineering tests
and analyses; and
(3)
use test equipment that has been properly calibrated for comparable test materials prior to usage.
(e)
sampling multiple segments of pipe. to verify material properties and attributes for a population of
multiple, comparable segments of pipe without traceable, verifiable, and complete records, an operator
may use a sampling program in accordance with the following requirements:
(1)
the operator must define separate populations of similar segments of pipe for each combination of
the following material properties and attributes: nominal wall thicknesses, grade, manufacturing
process, pipe manufacturing dates, and construction dates. if the dates between the manufacture or
construction of the pipeline segments exceeds 2 years, those segments cannot be considered as the
same vintage for the purpose of defining a population under this section. the total population
mileage is the cumulative mileage of pipeline segments in the population. the pipeline segments
need not be continuous.
(2)
for each population defined according to paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the operator must
determine material properties at all excavations that expose the pipe associated with anomaly direct
examinations, in situ evaluations, repairs, remediations, or maintenance, except for pipeline
segments exposed during excavation activities pursuant to § 192.614, until completion of the lesser
of the following:
(i)
one excavation per mile rounded up to the nearest whole number; or
(ii)
150 excavations if the population is more than 150 miles.
(3)
prior tests conducted for a single excavation according to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this
section may be counted as one sample under the sampling requirements of this paragraph (e).
(4)
if the test results identify line pipe with properties that are not consistent with available information
or existing expectations or assumed properties used for operations and maintenance in the past, the

is 36 inches (914 millimeters) below the underwater natural bottom (as determined by recognized
and generally accepted practices) for normal excavation or 18 inches (457 millimeters) for rock
excavation.
(i)
an operator may employ engineered alternatives to burial that meet or exceed the level of
protection provided by burial.
(ii)
if an operator cannot obtain required state or federal permits in time to comply with this
section, it must notify ops; specify whether the required permit is state or federal; and, justify
the delay.
(a)
each operator shall have a procedure for continuing surveillance of its facilities to determine and take
appropriate action concerning changes in class location, failures, leakage history, corrosion, substantial
changes in cathodic protection requirements, and other unusual operating and maintenance conditions.
(b)
if a segment of pipeline is determined to be in unsatisfactory condition but no immediate hazard exists,
the operator shall initiate a program to recondition or phase out the segment involved, or, if the segment
cannot be reconditioned or phased out, reduce the maximum allowable operating pressure in accordance
with § 192.619 (a) and (b).
(c)
following an extreme weather event or natural disaster that has the likelihood of damage to pipeline
facilities by the scouring or movement of the soil surrounding the pipeline or movement of the pipeline,
such as a named tropical storm or hurricane; a flood that exceeds the river, shoreline, or creek high-water
banks in the area of the pipeline; a landslide in the area of the pipeline; or an earthquake in the area of the
pipeline, an operator must inspect all potentially affected onshore transmission pipeline facilities to
detect conditions that could adversely affect the safe operation of that pipeline.

commence the inspection due to the unavailability of personnel or equipment, the operator must
notify the appropriate phmsa region director as soon as practicable.
(3)
an operator must take prompt and appropriate remedial action to ensure the safe operation of a
pipeline based on the information obtained as a result of performing the inspection required by
paragraph (c) of this section. such actions might include, but are not limited to:
(i)
reducing the operating pressure or shutting down the pipeline;
(ii)
modifying, repairing, or replacing any damaged pipeline facilities;
(iii) preventing, mitigating, or eliminating any unsafe conditions in the pipeline right-of-way;
(iv) performing additional patrols, surveys, tests, or inspections;
(v)
implementing emergency response activities with federal, state, or local personnel; or
(vi) notifying affected communities of the steps that can be taken to ensure public safety.
(a)
except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, each operator of a buried pipeline must carry
out, in accordance with this section, a written program to prevent damage to that pipeline from excavation
activities. for the purposes of this section, the term “excavation activities” includes excavation, blasting,
boring, tunneling, backfilling, the removal of aboveground structures by either explosive or mechanical
means, and other earthmoving operations.
(b)
an operator may comply with any of the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section through
participation in a public service program, such as a one-call system, but such participation does not
relieve the operator of responsibility for compliance with this section. however, an operator must perform
the duties of paragraph (c)(3) of this section through participation in a one-call system, if that one-call
system is a qualified one-call system. in areas that are covered by more than one qualified one-call
system, an operator need only join one of the qualified one-call systems if there is a central telephone
number for excavators to call for excavation activities, or if the one-call systems in those areas
communicate with one another. an operator's pipeline system must be covered by a qualified one-call
system where there is one in place. for the purpose of this section, a one-call system is considered a
“qualified one-call system” if it meets the requirements of section (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section.

appropriate regulatory agencies.
(j)
unless the operator transports gas as a primary activity, the operator of a master meter or petroleum gas
system is not required to develop a public awareness program as prescribed in paragraphs (a) through (g)
of this section. instead the operator must develop and implement a written procedure to provide its
customers public awareness messages twice annually. if the master meter or petroleum gas system is
located on property the operator does not control, the operator must provide similar messages twice
annually to persons controlling the property. the public awareness message must include:
(1)
a description of the purpose and reliability of the pipeline;
(2)
an overview of the hazards of the pipeline and prevention measures used;
(3)
information about damage prevention;
(4)
how to recognize and respond to a leak; and
(5)
how to get additional information.
(a)
post-failure and incident procedures. each operator must establish and follow procedures for investigating
and analyzing failures and incidents as defined in § 191.3, including sending the failed pipe, component,
or equipment for laboratory testing or examination, where appropriate, for the purpose of determining the
causes and contributing factor(s) of the failure or incident and minimizing the possibility of a recurrence.
(b)
post-failure and incident lessons learned. each operator of a transmission or distribution pipeline must
develop, implement, and incorporate lessons learned from a post-failure or incident review into its written
procedures, including personnel training and qualification programs; and design, construction, testing,

(c)
analysis of rupture and valve shutoffs. if an incident on an onshore gas transmission pipeline involves the
closure of a rupture-mitigation valve (rmv), as defined at § 192.3, or the closure of alternative equivalent
technology, the operator of the pipeline must also conduct a post-incident analysis of all of the factors
that may have impacted the release volume and the consequences of the incident and identify and
implement operations and maintenance measures to prevent or minimize the consequences of a future
incident. the requirements of this paragraph (c) are not applicable to gas distribution or gas gathering
pipelines. the analysis must include all relevant factors impacting the release volume and consequences,
including, but not limited to, the following:
(1)
detection, identification, operational response, system shut-off, and emergency response
communications, based on the type and volume of the incident;
(2)
appropriateness and effectiveness of procedures and pipeline systems, including supervisory
control and data acquisition (scada), communications, valve shut-off, and operator personnel;
(3)
actual response time from identifying a rupture following a notification of potential rupture, as
defined at § 192.3, to initiation of mitigative actions and isolation of the pipeline segment, and the
appropriateness and effectiveness of the mitigative actions taken;
(4)
location and timeliness of actuation of rmvs or alternative equivalent technologies; and
(5)
all other factors the operator deems appropriate.
(d)
rupture post-failure and incident summary. if a failure or incident on an onshore gas transmission pipeline
involves the identification of a rupture following a notification of potential rupture, or the closure of an
rmv (as those terms are defined at § 192.3), or the closure of an alternative equivalent technology, the
operator of the pipeline must complete a summary of the post-failure or incident review required by
paragraph (c) of this section within 90 days of the incident, and while the investigation is pending,
conduct quarterly status reviews until the investigation is complete and a final post-incident summary is
prepared. the final post-failure or incident summary, and all other reviews and analyses produced under
the requirements of this section, must be reviewed, dated, and signed by the operator's appropriate senior
executive officer. the final post-failure or incident summary, all investigation and analysis documents
used to prepare it, and records of lessons learned must be kept for the useful life of the pipeline. the
requirements of this paragraph (d) are not applicable to gas distribution or gas gathering pipelines.

the following
areas:
take the following additional step:
corrosion
control through
indirect
assessment
192.620(c)(1) of an existing pipeline segment under this section, assess the
adequacy of the cathodic protection through an indirect method such as close-
interval survey, and the integrity of the coating using direct current voltage
gradient (dcvg) or alternating current voltage gradient (acvg).
(ii) remediate any construction damaged coating with a voltage drop classified
as moderate or severe (ir drop greater than 35% for dcvg or 50 dbµv for acvg)
under section 4 of nace rp-0502-2002 (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7).
(iii) within six months after completing the baseline internal inspection required
under paragraph (d)(9) of this section, integrate the results of the indirect
assessment required under paragraph (d)(7)(i) of this section with the results of
the baseline internal inspection and take any needed remedial actions.
(iv) for all pipeline segments in high consequence areas, perform periodic
assessments as follows:
(a) conduct periodic close interval surveys with current interrupted to confirm
voltage drops in association with periodic assessments under subpart o of this
part.
(b) locate pipe-to-soil test stations at half-mile intervals within each high
consequence area ensuring at least one station is within each high consequence
area, if practicable.

of protection required in subpart i of this part, complete remedial action within six
months of the failed reading or notify each phmsa pipeline safety regional office
where the pipeline is in service demonstrating that the integrity of the pipeline is
not compromised if the repair takes longer than 6 months. an operator must also
notify a state pipeline safety authority when the pipeline is located in a state

(3)
if operational and environmental constraints limit an operator from meeting the deadlines in §
192.624, the operator may petition for an extension of the completion deadlines by up to 1 year,
upon submittal of a notification in accordance with § 192.18. the notification must include an up-to-
date plan for completing all actions in accordance with this section, the reason for the requested
extension, current status, proposed completion date, outstanding remediation activities, and any
needed temporary measures needed to mitigate the impact on safety.
(c)
maximum allowable operating pressure determination. operators of a pipeline segment meeting a
condition in paragraph (a) of this section must reconfirm its maop using one of the following methods:
(1)
method 1: pressure test. perform a pressure test and verify material properties records in
accordance with § 192.607 and the following requirements:
(i)
pressure test. perform a pressure test in accordance with subpart j of this part. the maop
must be equal to the test pressure divided by the greater of either 1.25 or the applicable class
location factor in § 192.619(a)(2)(ii).
(ii)
material properties records. determine if the following material properties records are
documented in traceable, verifiable, and complete records: diameter, wall thickness, seam type,
and grade (minimum yield strength, ultimate tensile strength).
(iii) material properties verification. if any of the records required by paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this
section are not documented in traceable, verifiable, and complete records, the operator must
obtain the missing records in accordance with § 192.607. an operator must test the pipe
materials cut out from the test manifold sites at the time the pressure test is conducted. if
there is a failure during the pressure test, the operator must test any removed pipe from the
pressure test failure in accordance with § 192.607.
(2)
method 2: pressure reduction. reduce pressure, as necessary, and limit maop to no greater than the
highest actual operating pressure sustained by the pipeline during the 5 years preceding october 1,
2019, divided by the greater of 1.25 or the applicable class location factor in § 192.619(a)(2)(ii). the
highest actual sustained pressure must have been reached for a minimum cumulative duration of 8
hours during a continuous 30-day period. the value used as the highest actual sustained operating
pressure must account for differences between upstream and downstream pressure on the pipeline
by use of either the lowest maximum pressure value for the entire pipeline segment or using the
operating pressure gradient along the entire pipeline segment (i.e., the location-specific operating
pressure at each location).
(i)
where the pipeline segment has had a class location change in accordance with § 192.611, and
records documenting diameter, wall thickness, seam type, grade (minimum yield strength and
ultimate tensile strength), and pressure tests are not documented in traceable, verifiable, and
complete records, the operator must reduce the pipeline segment maop as follows:
(a)
for pipeline segments where a class location changed from class 1 to class 2, from class
2 to class 3, or from class 3 to class 4, reduce the pipeline maop to no greater than the
highest actual operating pressure sustained by the pipeline during the 5 years preceding
october 1, 2019, divided by 1.39 for class 1 to class 2, 1.67 for class 2 to class 3, and
2.00 for class 3 to class 4.
(b)
for pipeline segments where a class location changed from class 1 to class 3, reduce the
pipeline maop to no greater than the highest actual operating pressure sustained by the
pipeline during the 5 years preceding october 1, 2019, divided by 2.00.

(ii)
future uprating of the pipeline segment in accordance with subpart k is allowed if the maop is
established using method 2.
(iii) if an operator elects to use method 2, but desires to use a less conservative pressure reduction
factor or longer look-back period, the operator must notify phmsa in accordance with § 192.18
no later than 7 calendar days after establishing the reduced maop. the notification must
include the following details:

growth analysis that complies with § 192.712;
(c)
justification that establishing maop by another method allowed by this section is
impractical;
(d)
justification that the reduced maop determined by the operator is safe based on analysis
of the condition of the pipeline segment, including material properties records, material
properties verified in accordance § 192.607, and the history of the pipeline segment,
particularly known corrosion and leakage, and the actual operating pressure, and
additional compensatory preventive and mitigative measures taken or planned; and
(e)
planned duration for operating at the requested maop, long-term remediation measures
and justification of this operating time interval, including fracture mechanics modeling for
failure stress pressures and cyclic fatigue growth analysis and other validated forms of
engineering analysis that have been reviewed and confirmed by subject matter experts.
(3)
method 3: engineering critical assessment (eca). conduct an eca in accordance with § 192.632.
(4)
method 4: pipe replacement. replace the pipeline segment in accordance with this part.
(5)
method 5: pressure reduction for pipeline segments with small potential impact radius. pipelines
with a potential impact radius (pir) less than or equal to 150 feet may establish the maop as
follows:
(i)
reduce the maop to no greater than the highest actual operating pressure sustained by the
pipeline during 5 years preceding october 1, 2019, divided by 1.1. the highest actual sustained
pressure must have been reached for a minimum cumulative duration of 8 hours during one
continuous 30-day period. the reduced maop must account for differences between discharge
and upstream pressure on the pipeline by use of either the lowest value for the entire pipeline
segment or the operating pressure gradient (i.e., the location specific operating pressure at
each location);

§ 192.632 engineering critical assessment for maximum allowable operating pressure
reconfirmation: onshore steel transmission pipelines.
when an operator conducts an maop reconfirmation in accordance with § 192.624(c)(3) “method 3” using an eca
to establish the material strength and maop of the pipeline segment, the eca must comply with the requirements
of this section. the eca must assess: threats; loadings and operational circumstances relevant to those threats,
including along the pipeline right-of way; outcomes of the threat assessment; relevant mechanical and fracture
properties; in-service degradation or failure processes; and initial and final defect size relevance. the eca must
quantify the interacting effects of threats on any defect in the pipeline.
(v)
scada system configuration; and
(vi) scada system performance.
(2)
include lessons learned from the operator's experience in the training program required by this
section.
(h)
training. each operator must establish a controller training program and review the training program
content to identify potential improvements at least once each calendar year, but at intervals not to exceed
15 months. an operator's program must provide for training each controller to carry out the roles and
responsibilities defined by the operator. in addition, the training program must include the following
elements:
(1)
responding to abnormal operating conditions likely to occur simultaneously or in sequence;
(2)
use of a computerized simulator or non-computerized (tabletop) method for training controllers to
recognize abnormal operating conditions;
(3)
training controllers on their responsibilities for communication under the operator's emergency
response procedures;
(4)
training that will provide a controller a working knowledge of the pipeline system, especially during
the development of abnormal operating conditions;
(5)
for pipeline operating setups that are periodically, but infrequently used, providing an opportunity for
controllers to review relevant procedures in advance of their application; and
(6)
control room team training and exercises that include both controllers and other individuals, defined
by the operator, who would reasonably be expected to operationally collaborate with controllers
(control room personnel) during normal, abnormal or emergency situations. operators must comply
with the team training requirements under this paragraph by no later than january 23, 2018.
(i)
compliance validation. upon request, operators must submit their procedures to phmsa or, in the case of
an intrastate pipeline facility regulated by a state, to the appropriate state agency.
(j)
compliance and deviations. an operator must maintain for review during inspection:
(1)
records that demonstrate compliance with the requirements of this section; and
(2)
documentation to demonstrate that any deviation from the procedures required by this section was
necessary for the safe operation of a pipeline facility.

(a)
eca analysis.
(1)
the material properties required to perform an eca analysis in accordance with this paragraph are
as follows: diameter, wall thickness, seam type, grade (minimum yield strength and ultimate tensile
strength), and charpy v-notch toughness values based upon the lowest operational temperatures, if
applicable. if any material properties required to perform an eca for any pipeline segment in
accordance with this paragraph are not documented in traceable, verifiable and complete records, an
operator must use conservative assumptions and include the pipeline segment in its program to
verify the undocumented information in accordance with § 192.607. the eca must integrate,
analyze, and account for the material properties, the results of all tests, direct examinations,
destructive tests, and assessments performed in accordance with this section, along with other
pertinent information related to pipeline integrity, including close interval surveys, coating surveys,
interference surveys required by subpart i of this part, cause analyses of prior incidents, prior
pressure test leaks and failures, other leaks, pipe inspections, and prior integrity assessments,
including those required by §§ 192.617, 192.710, and subpart o of this part.
(2)
the eca must analyze and determine the predicted failure pressure for the defect being assessed
using procedures that implement the appropriate failure criteria and justification as follows:
(i)
the eca must analyze any cracks or crack-like defects remaining in the pipe, or that could
remain in the pipe, to determine the predicted failure pressure of each defect in accordance
with § 192.712.
(ii)
the eca must analyze any metal loss defects not associated with a dent, including corrosion,
gouges, scrapes or other metal loss defects that could remain in the pipe, to determine the
predicted failure pressure. asme/ansi b31g (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7) or r-
streng (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7) must be used for corrosion defects. both
procedures and their analysis apply to corroded regions that do not penetrate the pipe wall over
80 percent of the wall thickness and are subject to the limitations prescribed in the equations'
procedures. the eca must use conservative assumptions for metal loss dimensions (length,
width, and depth).
(iii) when determining the predicted failure pressure for gouges, scrapes, selective seam weld
corrosion, crack-related defects, or any defect within a dent, appropriate failure criteria and
justification of the criteria must be used and documented.
(iv) if smys or actual material yield and ultimate tensile strength is not known or not documented
by traceable, verifiable, and complete records, then the operator must assume 30,000 p.s.i. or
determine the material properties using § 192.607.
(3)
the eca must analyze the interaction of defects to conservatively determine the most limiting
predicted failure pressure. examples include, but are not limited to, cracks in or near locations with
corrosion metal loss, dents with gouges or other metal loss, or cracks in or near dents or other
deformation damage. the eca must document all evaluations and any assumptions used in the eca
process.
(4)
the maop must be established at the lowest predicted failure pressure for any known or postulated
defect, or interacting defects, remaining in the pipe divided by the greater of 1.25 or the applicable
factor listed in § 192.619(a)(2)(ii).

(b)
assessment to determine defects remaining in the pipe. an operator must utilize previous pressure tests or
develop and implement an assessment program to determine the size of defects remaining in the pipe to
be analyzed in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.
(1)
an operator may use a previous pressure test that complied with subpart j to determine the defects
remaining in the pipe if records for a pressure test meeting the requirements of subpart j of this part
exist for the pipeline segment. the operator must calculate the largest defect that could have
survived the pressure test. the operator must predict how much the defects have grown since the
date of the pressure test in accordance with § 192.712. the eca must analyze the predicted size of
the largest defect that could have survived the pressure test that could remain in the pipe at the time
the eca is performed. the operator must calculate the remaining life of the most severe defects that
could have survived the pressure test and establish a re-assessment interval in accordance with the
methodology in § 192.712.
(2)
operators may use an inline inspection program in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
(3)
operators may use “other technology” if it is validated by a subject matter expert to produce an
equivalent understanding of the condition of the pipe equal to or greater than pressure testing or an
inline inspection program. if an operator elects to use “other technology” in the eca, it must notify
phmsa in advance of using the other technology in accordance with § 192.18. the “other
technology” notification must have:
(i)
descriptions of the technology or technologies to be used for all tests, examinations, and
assessments, including characterization of defect size used in the crack assessments (length,
depth, and volumetric); and
(ii)
procedures and processes to conduct tests, examinations, assessments and evaluations,
analyze defects, and remediate defects discovered.
(c)
in-line inspection. an inline inspection (ili) program to determine the defects remaining the pipe for the
eca analysis must be performed using tools that can detect wall loss, deformation from dents, wrinkle
bends, ovalities, expansion, seam defects, including cracking and selective seam weld corrosion,
longitudinal, circumferential and girth weld cracks, hard spot cracking, and stress corrosion cracking.
(1)
if a pipeline has segments that might be susceptible to hard spots based on assessment, leak,
failure, manufacturing vintage history, or other information, then the ili program must include a tool
that can detect hard spots.
(2)
if the pipeline has had a reportable incident, as defined in § 191.3, attributed to a girth weld failure
since its most recent pressure test, then the ili program must include a tool that can detect girth
weld defects unless the eca analysis performed in accordance with this section includes an
engineering evaluation program to analyze and account for the susceptibility of girth weld failure due
to lateral stresses.
(3)
inline inspection must be performed in accordance with § 192.493.
(4)
an operator must use unity plots or equivalent methodologies to validate the performance of the ili
tools in identifying and sizing actionable manufacturing and construction related anomalies. enough
data points must be used to validate tool performance at the same or better statistical confidence
level provided in the tool specifications. the operator must have a process for identifying defects
outside the tool performance specifications and following up with the ili vendor to conduct
additional in-field examinations, reanalyze ili data, or both.

§ 192.634 transmission lines: onshore valve shut-off for rupture mitigation.
(5)
interpretation and evaluation of assessment results must meet the requirements of §§ 192.710,
192.713, and subpart o of this part, and must conservatively account for the accuracy and reliability
of ili, in-the-ditch examination methods and tools, and any other assessment and examination
results used to determine the actual sizes of cracks, metal loss, deformation and other defect
dimensions by applying the most conservative limit of the tool tolerance specification. ili and in-the-
ditch examination tools and procedures for crack assessments (length and depth) must have
performance and evaluation standards confirmed for accuracy through confirmation tests for the
defect types and pipe material vintage being evaluated. inaccuracies must be accounted for in the
procedures for evaluations and fracture mechanics models for predicted failure pressure
determinations.
(6)
anomalies detected by ili assessments must be remediated in accordance with applicable criteria in
§§ 192.713 and 192.933.
(d)
defect remaining life. if any pipeline segment contains cracking or may be susceptible to cracking or
crack-like defects found through or identified by assessments, leaks, failures, manufacturing vintage
histories, or any other available information about the pipeline, the operator must estimate the remaining
life of the pipeline in accordance with § 192.712.
(e)
records. an operator must retain records of investigations, tests, analyses, assessments, repairs,
replacements, alterations, and other actions taken in accordance with the requirements of this section for
the life of the pipeline.
(a)
applicability. for new or entirely replaced onshore transmission pipeline segments with diameters of 6
inches or greater that are located in high-consequence areas (hca) or class 3 or class 4 locations and
that are installed after april 10, 2023, an operator must install or use existing rupture-mitigation valves
(rmv), or an alternative equivalent technology, according to the requirements of this section and §§
192.179 and 192.636. rmvs and alternative equivalent technologies must be operational within 14 days
of placing the new or replaced pipeline segment into service. an operator may request an extension of
this 14-day operation requirement if it can demonstrate to phmsa, in accordance with the notification
procedures in § 192.18, that application of that requirement would be economically, technically, or
operationally infeasible. the requirements of this section apply to all applicable pipe replacement
projects, even those that do not otherwise involve the addition or replacement of a valve. this section
does not apply to pipe segments in class 1 or class 2 locations that have a potential impact radius (pir),
as defined in § 192.903, that is less than or equal to 150 feet.
(b)
maximum spacing between valves. rmvs, or alternative equivalent technology, must be installed in
accordance with the following requirements:
(1)
shut-off segment. for purposes of this section, a “shut-off segment” means the segment of pipe
located between the upstream valve closest to the upstream endpoint of the new or replaced class 3
or class 4 or hca pipeline segment and the downstream valve closest to the downstream endpoint
of the new or replaced class 3 or class 4 or hca pipeline segment so that the entirety of the
segment that is within the hca or the class 3 or class 4 location is between at least two rmvs or
alternative equivalent technologies. if any crossover or lateral pipe for gas receipts or deliveries
connects to the shut-off segment between the upstream and downstream valves, the shut-off

segment also must extend to a valve on the crossover connection(s) or lateral(s), such that, when all
valves are closed, there is no flow path for gas to be transported to the rupture site (except for
residual gas already in the shut-off segment). multiple class 3 or class 4 locations or hca segments
may be contained within a single shut-off segment. the operator is not required to select the closest
valve to the shut-off segment as the rmv, as that term is defined in § 192.3, or the alternative
equivalent technology. an operator may use a manual compressor station valve at a continuously
manned station as an alternative equivalent technology, but it must be able to be closed within 30
minutes following rupture identification, as that term is defined at § 192.3. such a valve used as an
alternative equivalent technology would not require a notification to phmsa in accordance with §
192.18.
(2)
shut-off segment valve spacing. a pipeline subject to paragraph (a) of this section must have rmvs
or alternative equivalent technology on the upstream and downstream side of the pipeline segment.
the distance between rmvs or alternative equivalent technologies must not exceed:
(i)
eight (8) miles for any class 4 location,
(ii)
fifteen (15) miles for any class 3 location, or
(iii) twenty (20) miles for all other locations.
(3)
laterals. laterals extending from shut-off segments that contribute less than 5 percent of the total
shut-off segment volume may have rmvs or alternative equivalent technologies that meet the
actuation requirements of this section at locations other than mainline receipt/delivery points, as
long as all of the laterals contributing gas volumes to the shut-off segment do not contribute more
than 5 percent of the total shut-off segment gas volume based upon maximum flow volume at the
operating pressure. for laterals that are 12 inches in diameter or less, a check valve that allows gas
to flow freely in one direction and contains a mechanism to automatically prevent flow in the other
direction may be used as an alternative equivalent technology where it is positioned to stop flow into
the shut-off segment. such check valves that are used as an alternative equivalent technology in
accordance with this paragraph (b)(3) are not subject to § 192.636, but they must be inspected,
operated, and remediated in accordance with § 192.745, including for closure and leakage to ensure
operational reliability. an operator using such a check valve as an alternative equivalent technology
must notify phmsa in accordance with §§ 192.18 and 192.179 and develop and implement
maintenance procedures for such equipment that meet § 192.745.
(4)
crossovers. an operator may use a manual valve as an alternative equivalent technology in lieu of an
rmv for a crossover connection if, during normal operations, the valve is closed to prevent the flow
of gas by the use of a locking device or other means designed to prevent the opening of the valve by
persons other than those authorized by the operator. the operator must develop and implement
operating procedures and document that the valve has been closed and locked in accordance with
the operator's lock-out and tag-out procedures to prevent the flow of gas. an operator using such a
manual valve as an alternative equivalent technology must notify phmsa in accordance with §§
192.18 and 192.179.

§ 192.635 notification of potential rupture.
[amdt. 192-130, 87 fr 20985, apr. 8, 2022, as amended by amdt. 192-136, 89 fr 53880, june 28, 2024]
§ 192.636 transmission lines: response to a rupture; capabilities of rupture-mitigation valves
(rmvs) or alternative equivalent technologies.
(a)
as used in this part, a “notification of potential rupture” refers to the notification of, or observation by, an
operator (e.g., by or to its controller(s) in a control room, field personnel, nearby pipeline or utility
personnel, the public, local responders, or public authorities) of one or more of the below indicia of a
potential unintentional or uncontrolled release of a large volume of gas from a pipeline:
(1)
an unanticipated or unexplained pressure loss outside of the pipeline's normal operating pressures,
as defined in the operator's written procedures. the operator must establish in its written procedures
that an unanticipated or unplanned pressure loss is outside of the pipeline's normal operating
pressures when there is a pressure loss greater than 10 percent occurring within a time interval of
15 minutes or less, unless the operator has documented in its written procedures the operational
need for a greater pressure-change threshold due to pipeline flow dynamics (including changes in
operating pressure, flow rate, or volume), that are caused by fluctuations in gas demand, gas
receipts, or gas deliveries; or
(2)
an unanticipated or unexplained flow rate change, pressure change, equipment function, or other
pipeline instrumentation indication at the upstream or downstream station that may be
representative of an event meeting paragraph (a)(1) of this section; or
(3)
any unanticipated or unexplained rapid release of a large volume of gas, a fire, or an explosion in the
immediate vicinity of the pipeline.
(b)
a notification of potential rupture occurs when an operator first receives notice of or observes an event
specified in paragraph (a) of this section.
(c)
this section does not apply to any gas gathering line.
(a)
scope. the requirements in this section apply to rupture-mitigation valves (rmvs), as defined in § 192.3,
or alternative equivalent technologies, installed pursuant to §§ 192.179(e), (f), and (g) and 192.634.
(b)
rupture identification and valve shut-off time. an operator must, as soon as practicable but within 30
minutes of rupture identification (see § 192.615(a)(12)), fully close any rmvs or alternative equivalent
technologies necessary to minimize the volume of gas released from a pipeline and mitigate the
consequences of a rupture.
(c)
open valves. an operator may leave an rmv or alternative equivalent technology open for more than 30
minutes, as required by paragraph (b) of this section, if the operator has previously established in its
operating procedures and demonstrated within a notice submitted under § 192.18 for phmsa review, that
closing the rmv or alternative equivalent technology would be detrimental to public safety. the request
must have been coordinated with appropriate local emergency responders, and the operator and
emergency responders must determine that it is safe to leave the valve open. operators must have written
procedures for determining whether to leave an rmv or alternative equivalent technology open, including
plans to communicate with local emergency responders and minimize environmental impacts, which
must be submitted as part of its notification to phmsa.

page 151 of 235

(d)
valve monitoring and operation capabilities. an rmv, as defined in § 192.3, or alternative equivalent
technology, must be capable of being monitored or controlled either remotely or by on-site personnel as
follows:
(1)
operated during normal, abnormal, and emergency operating conditions;
(2)
monitored for valve status (i.e., open, closed, or partial closed/open), upstream pressure, and
downstream pressure. for automatic shut-off valves (asv), an operator does not need to monitor
remotely a valve's status if the operator has the capability to monitor pressures or gas flow rate
within each pipeline segment located between rmvs or alternative equivalent technologies to
identify and locate a rupture. pipeline segments that use manual valves or other alternative
equivalent technologies must have the capability to monitor pressures or gas flow rates on the
pipeline to identify and locate a rupture; and
(3)
have a back-up power source to maintain scada systems or other remote communications for
remote-control valve (rcv) or automatic shut-off valve (asv) operational status, or be monitored
and controlled by on-site personnel.
(e)
monitoring of valve shut-off response status. the position and operational status of an rmv must be
appropriately monitored through electronic communication with remote instrumentation or other
equivalent means. an operator does not need to monitor remotely an asv's status if the operator has the
capability to monitor pressures or gas flow rate on the pipeline to identify and locate a rupture.
(f)
flow modeling for automatic shut-off valves. prior to using an asv as an rmv, an operator must conduct
flow modeling for the shut-off segment and any laterals that feed the shut-off segment, so that the valve
will close within 30 minutes or less following rupture identification, consistent with the operator's
procedures, and in accordance with § 192.3 and this section. the flow modeling must include the
anticipated maximum, normal, or any other flow volumes, pressures, or other operating conditions that
may be encountered during the year, not exceeding a period of 15 months, and it must be modeled for the
flow between the rmvs or alternative equivalent technologies, and any looped pipelines or gas receipt tie-
ins. if operating conditions change that could affect the asv set pressures and the 30-minute valve
closure time after notification of potential rupture, as defined at § 192.3, an operator must conduct a new
flow model and reset the asv set pressures prior to the next review for asv set pressures in accordance
with § 192.745. the flow model must include a time/pressure chart for the segment containing the asv if
a rupture occurs. an operator must conduct this flow modeling prior to making flow condition changes in
a manner that could render the 30-minute valve closure time unachievable.
(g)
manual valves in non-hca, class 1 locations. for pipeline segments in a class 1 location that do not meet
the definition of a high consequence area (hca), an operator submitting a notification pursuant to §§
192.18 and 192.179 for use of manual valves as an alternative equivalent technology may also request an
exemption from the requirements of § 192.636(b).
(h)
manual operation upon identification of a rupture. operators using a manual valve as an alternative
equivalent technology as authorized pursuant to §§ 192.18, 192.179, and 192.634 and this section must
develop and implement operating procedures that appropriately designate and locate nearby personnel to
ensure valve shutoff in accordance with this section and § 192.634. manual operation of valves must
include time for the assembly of necessary operating personnel, the acquisition of necessary tools and
equipment, driving time under heavy traffic conditions and at the posted speed limit, walking time to
access the valve, and time to shut off all valves manually, not to exceed the maximum response time
allowed under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.

pipeline is susceptible, such as corrosion, deformation and mechanical damage (e.g., dents, gouges
and grooves), material cracking and crack-like defects (e.g., stress corrosion cracking, selective
seam weld corrosion, environmentally assisted cracking, and girth weld cracks), hard spots with
cracking, and any other threats to which the covered segment is susceptible. when performing an
assessment using an in-line inspection tool, an operator must comply with § 192.493;
(2)
pressure test. pressure test conducted in accordance with subpart j of this part. the use of subpart
j pressure testing is appropriate for threats such as internal corrosion, external corrosion, and other
environmentally assisted corrosion mechanisms; manufacturing and related defect threats,

(e)
discovery of condition. discovery of a condition occurs when an operator has adequate information about
a condition to determine that the condition presents a potential threat to the integrity of the pipeline. an
operator must promptly, but no later than 180 days after conducting an integrity assessment, obtain
sufficient information about a condition to make that determination, unless the operator demonstrates
that 180 days is impracticable.
(f)
remediation. an operator must comply with the requirements in §§ 192.485, 192.711, 192.712, 192.713,
and 192.714, where applicable, if a condition that could adversely affect the safe operation of a pipeline is
discovered.
(g)
analysis of information. an operator must analyze and account for all available relevant information about
a pipeline in complying with the requirements in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section.
(a)
temporary repairs. each operator must take immediate temporary measures to protect the public
whenever:
(1)
a leak, imperfection, or damage that impairs its serviceability is found in a segment of steel
transmission line operating at or above 40 percent of the smys; and
(2)
it is not feasible to make a permanent repair at the time of discovery.
(b)
permanent repairs. an operator must make permanent repairs on its pipeline system according to the
following:
(1)
(i)
non-integrity management repairs for gathering lines and offshore transmission lines: for
gathering lines subject to this section in accordance with § 192.9 and for offshore transmission
lines, an operator must make permanent repairs as soon as feasible.
(ii)
non-integrity management repairs for onshore transmission lines: except for gathering lines
exempted from this section in accordance with § 192.9 and offshore transmission lines, after
may 24, 2023, whenever an operator discovers any condition that could adversely affect the
safe operation of a pipeline segment not covered by an integrity management program under
subpart o of this part, it must correct the condition as prescribed in § 192.714.
(2)
integrity management repairs: when an operator discovers a condition on a pipeline covered under
subpart o-gas transmission pipeline integrity management, the operator must remediate the
condition as prescribed by § 192.933(d).

§ 192.712 analysis of predicted failure pressure and critical strain level.
(a)
applicability. whenever required by this part, operators of onshore steel transmission pipelines must
analyze anomalies or defects to determine the predicted failure pressure at the location of the anomaly or
defect, and the remaining life of the pipeline segment at the location of the anomaly or defect, in
accordance with this section.
(b)
corrosion metal loss. when analyzing corrosion metal loss under this section, an operator must use a
suitable remaining strength calculation method including, asme/ansi b31g (incorporated by reference,
see § 192.7); r-streng (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7); or an alternative equivalent method of
remaining strength calculation that will provide an equally conservative result.
(1)
if an operator would choose to use a remaining strength calculation method that could provide a less
conservative result than the methods listed in paragraph (b) introductory text, the operator must
notify phmsa in advance in accordance with § 192.18(c).
(2)
the notification provided for by paragraph (b)(1) of this section must include a comparison of its
predicted failure pressures to r-streng or asme/ansi b31g, all burst pressure tests used, and any
other technical reviews used to qualify the calculation method(s) for varying corrosion profiles.
(c)
dents and other mechanical damage. to evaluate dents and other mechanical damage that could result in
a stress riser or other integrity impact, an operator must develop a procedure and perform an engineering
critical assessment as follows:
(1)
identify and evaluate potential threats to the pipe segment in the vicinity of the anomaly or defect,
including ground movement, external loading, fatigue, cracking, and corrosion.
(2)
review high-resolution magnetic flux leakage (hr-mfl) high-resolution deformation, inertial
mapping, and crack detection inline inspection data for damage in the dent area and any associated
weld region, including available data from previous inline inspections.
(3)
perform pipeline curvature-based strain analysis using recent hr-deformation inspection data.
(4)
compare the dent profile between the most recent and previous in-line inspections to identify
significant changes in dent depth and shape.
(5)
identify and quantify all previous and present significant loads acting on the dent.
(6)
evaluate the strain level associated with the anomaly or defect and any nearby welds using finite
element analysis, or other technology in accordance with this section. using finite element analysis
to quantify the dent strain, and then estimating and evaluating the damage using the strain limit
damage (sld) and ductile failure damage indicator (dfdi) at the dent, are appropriate evaluation
methods.
(7)
the analyses performed in accordance with this section must account for material property
uncertainties, model inaccuracies, and inline inspection tool sizing tolerances.
(8)
dents with a depth greater than 10 percent of the pipe outside diameter or with geometric strain
levels that exceed the lessor of 10 percent or exceed the critical strain for the pipe material
properties must be remediated in accordance with § 192.713, § 192.714, or § 192.933, as
applicable.

page 158 of 235

(9)
using operational pressure data, a valid fatigue life prediction model that is appropriate for the
pipeline segment, and assuming a reassessment safety factor of 5 or greater for the assessment
interval, estimate the fatigue life of the dent by finite element analysis or other analytical technique
that is technically appropriate for dent assessment and reassessment intervals in accordance with
this section. multiple dent or other fatigue models must be used for the evaluation as a part of the
engineering critical assessment.
(10) if the dent or mechanical damage is suspected to have cracks, then a crack growth rate assessment
is required to ensure adequate life for the dent with crack(s) until remediation or the dent with
crack(s) must be evaluated and remediated in accordance with the criteria and timing requirements
in § 192.713, § 192.714, or § 192.933, as applicable.
(11) an operator using an engineering critical assessment procedure, other technologies, or techniques to
comply with paragraph (c) of this section must submit advance notification to phmsa, with the
relevant procedures, in accordance with § 192.18.
(d)
cracks and crack-like defects —
(1)
crack analysis models. when analyzing cracks and crack-like defects under this section, an operator
must determine predicted failure pressure, failure stress pressure, and crack growth using a
technically proven fracture mechanics model appropriate to the failure mode (ductile, brittle or both),
material properties (pipe and weld properties), and boundary condition used (pressure test, ili, or
other).
(2)
analysis for crack growth and remaining life. if the pipeline segment is susceptible to cyclic fatigue or
other loading conditions that could lead to fatigue crack growth, fatigue analysis must be performed
using an applicable fatigue crack growth law (for example, paris law) or other technically
appropriate engineering methodology. for other degradation processes that can cause crack growth,
appropriate engineering analysis must be used. the above methodologies must be validated by a
subject matter expert to determine conservative predictions of flaw growth and remaining life at the
maximum allowable operating pressure. the operator must calculate the remaining life of the
pipeline by determining the amount of time required for the crack to grow to a size that would fail at
maximum allowable operating pressure.
(i)
when calculating crack size that would fail at maop, and the material toughness is not
documented in traceable, verifiable, and complete records, the same charpy v-notch toughness
value established in paragraph (e)(2) of this section must be used.
(ii)
initial and final flaw size must be determined using a fracture mechanics model appropriate to
the failure mode (ductile, brittle or both) and boundary condition used (pressure test, ili, or
other).
(iii) an operator must re-evaluate the remaining life of the pipeline before 50% of the remaining life
calculated by this analysis has expired. the operator must determine and document if further
pressure tests or use of other assessment methods are required at that time. the operator
must continue to re-evaluate the remaining life of the pipeline before 50% of the remaining life
calculated in the most recent evaluation has expired.
(3)
cracks that survive pressure testing. for cases in which the operator does not have in-line inspection
crack anomaly data and is analyzing potential crack defects that could have survived a pressure test,
the operator must calculate the largest potential crack defect sizes using the methods in paragraph
49 cfr part 192 (up to date as of 2/26/2025)

page 159 of 235

(d)(1) of this section. if pipe material toughness is not documented in traceable, verifiable, and
complete records, the operator must use one of the following for charpy v-notch toughness values
based upon minimum operational temperature and equivalent to a full-size specimen value:
(i)
charpy v-notch toughness values from comparable pipe with known properties of the same
vintage and from the same steel and pipe manufacturer;
(ii)
a conservative charpy v-notch toughness value to determine the toughness based upon the
material properties verification process specified in § 192.607;
(iii) a full size equivalent charpy v-notch upper-shelf toughness level of 120 ft.-lbs.; or
(iv) other appropriate values that an operator demonstrates can provide conservative charpy v-
notch toughness values of the crack-related conditions of the pipeline segment. operators
using an assumed charpy v-notch toughness value must notify phmsa in accordance with §
192.18.
(e)
data. in performing the analyses of predicted or assumed anomalies or defects in accordance with this
section, an operator must use data as follows.
(1)
an operator must explicitly analyze and account for uncertainties in reported assessment results
(including tool tolerance, detection threshold, probability of detection, probability of identification,
sizing accuracy, conservative anomaly interaction criteria, location accuracy, anomaly findings, and
unity chart plots or equivalent for determining uncertainties and verifying tool performance) in
identifying and characterizing the type and dimensions of anomalies or defects used in the analyses,
unless the defect dimensions have been verified using in situ direct measurements.
(2)
the analyses performed in accordance with this section must utilize pipe and material properties
that are documented in traceable, verifiable, and complete records. if documented data required for
any analysis is not available, an operator must obtain the undocumented data through § 192.607.
until documented material properties are available, the operator shall use conservative assumptions
as follows:
(i)
material toughness. an operator must use one of the following for material toughness:
(a)
charpy v-notch toughness values from comparable pipe with known properties of the
same vintage and from the same steel and pipe manufacturer;
(b)
a conservative charpy v-notch toughness value to determine the toughness based upon
the ongoing material properties verification process specified in § 192.607;
(c)
if the pipeline segment does not have a history of reportable incidents caused by cracking
or crack-like defects, maximum charpy v-notch toughness values of 13.0 ft.-lbs. for body
cracks and 4.0 ft.-lbs. for cold weld, lack of fusion, and selective seam weld corrosion
defects;
(d)
if the pipeline segment has a history of reportable incidents caused by cracking or crack-
like defects, maximum charpy v-notch toughness values of 5.0 ft.-lbs. for body cracks and
1.0 ft.-lbs. for cold weld, lack of fusion, and selective seam weld corrosion; or
(e)
other appropriate values that an operator demonstrates can provide conservative charpy
v-notch toughness values of crack-related conditions of the pipeline segment. operators
using an assumed charpy v-notch toughness value must notify phmsa in advance in

determined and documented in accordance with § 192.607, the operator must use values upon
which the current maop is based.
(f)
review. analyses conducted in accordance with this section must be reviewed and confirmed by a subject
matter expert.
(g)
records. an operator must keep for the life of the pipeline records of the investigations, analyses, and

(2)
if the anomaly is outside of an hca, the operator must perform a reassessment of the anomaly
within a maximum of 10 years in accordance with § 192.710(b), unless the anomaly safety factor is
expected to go below what is specified in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section.
(a)
each imperfection or damage that impairs the serviceability of pipe in a steel transmission line operating
at or above 40 percent of smys must be—
(1)
removed by cutting out and replacing a cylindrical piece of pipe; or
(2)
repaired by a method that reliable engineering tests and analyses show can permanently restore the
serviceability of the pipe.
(b)
operating pressure must be at a safe level during repair operations.
(a)
applicability. this section applies to onshore transmission pipelines not subject to the repair criteria in
subpart o of this part, and which do not operate under an alternative maop in accordance with §§
192.112, 192.328, and 192.620. pipeline segments that are located in high consequence areas, as defined
in § 192.903, must comply with the applicable actions specified by the integrity management
requirements in subpart o. pipeline segments operating under an alternative maop in accordance with
§§ 192.112, 192.328, and 192.620 must comply with § 192.620(d)(11).

document the reasons why it cannot meet the schedule and how the changed schedule will not jeopardize
public safety. each condition that meets any of the repair criteria in paragraph (d) of this section in an
onshore steel transmission pipeline must be—
(1)
removed by cutting out and replacing a cylindrical piece of pipe that will permanently restore the
pipeline's maop based on the use of § 192.105 and the design factors for the class location in
which it is located; or
(2)

permanently restore the pipeline's maop based upon the determined predicted failure pressure
times the design factor for the class location in which it is located.
(d)
remediation of certain conditions. for onshore transmission pipelines not located in high consequence
areas, an operator must remediate a listed condition according to the following criteria:
(1)
immediate repair conditions. an operator's evaluation and remediation schedule for immediate repair
conditions must follow section 7 of asme/ansi b31.8s-2004 (incorporated by reference, see §
192.7). an operator must repair the following conditions immediately upon discovery:

§ 192.715 transmission lines: permanent field repair of welds.
each weld that is unacceptable under § 192.241(c) must be repaired as follows:
(3)
when a pressure reduction, in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, exceeds 365 days, an
operator must notify phmsa in accordance with § 192.18 and explain the reasons for the
remediation delay. this notice must include a technical justification that the continued pressure
reduction will not jeopardize the integrity of the pipeline.
(4)
an operator must document and keep records of the calculations and decisions used to determine
the reduced operating pressure and the implementation of the actual reduced operating pressure for
a period of 5 years after the pipeline has been repaired.

take appropriate remedial action to correct any condition that could adversely affect the safe operation of
a pipeline system in accordance with the criteria, schedules, and methods defined in the operator's
operating and maintenance procedures.
(g)
in situ direct examination of crack defects. whenever an operator finds conditions that require the pipeline
to be repaired, in accordance with this section, an operator must perform a direct examination of known
locations of cracks or crack-like defects using technology that has been validated to detect tight cracks
(equal to or less than 0.008 inches crack opening), such as inverse wave field extrapolation (iwex),
phased array ultrasonic testing (paut), ultrasonic testing (ut), or equivalent technology. “in situ”
examination tools and procedures for crack assessments (length, depth, and volumetric) must have
performance and evaluation standards, including pipe or weld surface cleanliness standards for the
inspection, confirmed by subject matter experts qualified by knowledge, training, and experience in direct
examination inspection for accuracy of the type of defects and pipe material being evaluated. the
procedures must account for inaccuracies in evaluations and fracture mechanics models for failure
pressure determinations.
(h)

if:
(1)
the weld is not leaking;
(2)
the pressure in the segment is reduced so that it does not produce a stress that is more than 20
percent of the smys of the pipe; and
(3)
grinding of the defective area can be limited so that at least 1⁄8-inch (3.2 millimeters) thickness in the
pipe weld remains.

192.634 that is manually or locally operated (i.e., not a rupture-mitigation valve (rmv), as that term is
defined in § 192.3):
(1)
operators must achieve a valve closure time of 30 minutes or less, pursuant to § 192.636(b), through
an initial drill and through periodic validation as required in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. an
operator must review and document the results of each phase of the drill response to validate the
total response time, including confirming the rupture, and valve shut-off time as being less than or
equal to 30 minutes after rupture identification.
(2)
within each pipeline system and within each operating or maintenance field work unit, operators
must randomly select a valve serving as an alternative equivalent technology in lieu of an rmv for an
annual 30-minute-total response time validation drill that simulates worst-case conditions for that
location to ensure compliance with § 192.636. operators are not required to close the valve fully
during the drill; a minimum 25 percent valve closure is sufficient to demonstrate compliance with
drill requirements unless the operator has operational information that requires an additional closure
percentage for maintaining reliability. the response drill must occur at least once each calendar year,
with intervals not to exceed 15 months. operators must include in their written procedures the
method they use to randomly select which alternative equivalent technology is tested in accordance
with this paragraph.
(3)
if the 30-minute-maximum response time cannot be achieved during the drill, the operator must
revise response efforts to achieve compliance with § 192.636 as soon as practicable but no later
than 12 months after the drill. alternative valve shut-off measures must be in place in accordance
with paragraph (e) of this section within 7 days of a failed drill.
(4)
based on the results of response-time drills, the operator must include lessons learned in:
(i)
training and qualifications programs;
(ii)
design, construction, testing, maintenance, operating, and emergency procedures manuals; and
(iii) any other areas identified by the operator as needing improvement.
(5)
the requirements of this paragraph (d) do not apply to manual valves who, pursuant to § 192.636(g),
have been exempted from the requirements of § 192.636(b).
(e)
each operator must develop and implement remedial measures to correct any valve installed on an
onshore pipeline under § 192.179(e) or (f) or § 192.634 that is indicated to be inoperable or unable to
maintain effective shut-off as follows:
(1)
repair or replace the valve as soon as practicable but no later than 12 months after finding that the
valve is inoperable or unable to maintain effective shut-off. an operator must request an extension
from phmsa in accordance with § 192.18 if repair or replacement of a valve within 12 months would
be economically, technically, or operationally infeasible; and
(2)
designate an alternative valve acting as an rmv within 7 calendar days of the finding while repairs
are being made and document an interim response plan to maintain safety. such valves are not
required to comply with the valve spacing requirements of this part.

subpart o—gas transmission pipeline integrity management
source: 68 fr 69817, dec. 15, 2003, unless otherwise noted.
§ 192.901 what do the regulations in this subpart cover?
this subpart prescribes minimum requirements for an integrity management program on any gas transmission
pipeline covered under this part. for gas transmission pipelines constructed of plastic, only the requirements in §§
192.917, 192.921, 192.935 and 192.937 apply.
§ 192.903 what definitions apply to this subpart?
the following definitions apply to this subpart:
(b)
records supporting an individual's current qualification shall be maintained while the individual is
performing the covered task. records of prior qualification and records of individuals no longer
performing covered tasks shall be retained for a period of five years.
(a)
operators must have a written qualification program by april 27, 2001. the program must be available for
review by the administrator or by a state agency participating under 49 u.s.c. chapter 601 if the program
is under the authority of that state agency.
(b)
operators must complete the qualification of individuals performing covered tasks by october 28, 2002.

assessment is the use of testing techniques as allowed in this subpart to ascertain the condition of a covered
pipeline segment.
confirmatory direct assessment is an integrity assessment method using more focused application of the
principles and techniques of direct assessment to identify internal and external corrosion in a covered
transmission pipeline segment.
covered segment or covered pipeline segment means a segment of gas transmission pipeline located in a high
consequence area. the terms gas and transmission line are defined in § 192.3.

direct assessment is an integrity assessment method that utilizes a process to evaluate certain threats (i.e.,
external corrosion, internal corrosion and stress corrosion cracking) to a covered pipeline segment's
integrity. the process includes the gathering and integration of risk factor data, indirect examination or
analysis to identify areas of suspected corrosion, direct examination of the pipeline in these areas, and
post assessment evaluation.
high consequence area means an area established by one of the methods described in paragraphs (1) or (2) as
follows:
(1)
an area defined as—
(i)
a class 3 location under § 192.5; or
(ii)
a class 4 location under § 192.5; or
(iii) any area in a class 1 or class 2 location where the potential impact radius is greater than 660
feet (200 meters), and the area within a potential impact circle contains 20 or more buildings
intended for human occupancy; or
(iv) any area in a class 1 or class 2 location where the potential impact circle contains an identified
site.
(2)
the area within a potential impact circle containing—
(i)
20 or more buildings intended for human occupancy, unless the exception in paragraph (4)
applies; or
(ii)
an identified site.
(3)
where a potential impact circle is calculated under either method (1) or (2) to establish a high
consequence area, the length of the high consequence area extends axially along the length of the
pipeline from the outermost edge of the first potential impact circle that contains either an identified
site or 20 or more buildings intended for human occupancy to the outermost edge of the last
contiguous potential impact circle that contains either an identified site or 20 or more buildings
intended for human occupancy. (see figure e.i.a. in appendix e.)
(4)
if in identifying a high consequence area under paragraph (1)(iii) of this definition or paragraph (2)(i)
of this definition, the radius of the potential impact circle is greater than 660 feet (200 meters), the
operator may identify a high consequence area based on a prorated number of buildings intended
for human occupancy with a distance of 660 feet (200 meters) from the centerline of the pipeline
until december 17, 2006. if an operator chooses this approach, the operator must prorate the
number of buildings intended for human occupancy based on the ratio of an area with a radius of
660 feet (200 meters) to the area of the potential impact circle (i.e., the prorated number of buildings
intended for human occupancy is equal to 20 × (660 feet) [or 200 meters]/potential impact radius in
feet [or meters]2).
identified site means each of the following areas:
(a)
an outside area or open structure that is occupied by twenty (20) or more persons on at least 50
days in any twelve (12)-month period. (the days need not be consecutive.) examples include but are
not limited to, beaches, playgrounds, recreational facilities, camping grounds, outdoor theaters,
stadiums, recreational areas near a body of water, or areas outside a rural building such as a
religious facility; or

§ 192.905 how does an operator identify a high consequence area?
(b)
a building that is occupied by twenty (20) or more persons on at least five (5) days a week for ten
(10) weeks in any twelve (12)-month period. (the days and weeks need not be consecutive.)
examples include, but are not limited to, religious facilities, office buildings, community centers,
general stores, 4-h facilities, or roller skating rinks; or
(c)
a facility occupied by persons who are confined, are of impaired mobility, or would be difficult to
evacuate. examples include but are not limited to hospitals, prisons, schools, day-care facilities,
retirement facilities or assisted-living facilities.
potential impact circle is a circle of radius equal to the potential impact radius (pir).
potential impact radius (pir) means the radius of a circle within which the potential failure of a pipeline could
have significant impact on people or property. pir is determined by the formula r = 0.69* (square root of
(p*d2)), where ‘r’ is the radius of a circular area in feet surrounding the point of failure, ‘p’ is the maximum
allowable operating pressure (maop) in the pipeline segment in pounds per square inch and ‘d’ is the
nominal diameter of the pipeline in inches.
remediation is a repair or mitigation activity an operator takes on a covered segment to limit or reduce the
probability of an undesired event occurring or the expected consequences from the event.
(a)
general. to determine which segments of an operator's transmission pipeline system are covered by this
subpart, an operator must identify the high consequence areas. an operator must use method (1) or (2)
from the definition in § 192.903 to identify a high consequence area. an operator may apply one method
to its entire pipeline system, or an operator may apply one method to individual portions of the pipeline
system. an operator must describe in its integrity management program which method it is applying to
each portion of the operator's pipeline system. the description must include the potential impact radius
when utilized to establish a high consequence area. (see appendix e.i. for guidance on identifying high
consequence areas.)
(b)
(1)
identified sites. an operator must identify an identified site, for purposes of this subpart, from
information the operator has obtained from routine operation and maintenance activities and from

(b)
data gathering and integration. to identify and evaluate the potential threats to a covered pipeline
segment, an operator must gather and integrate existing data and information on the entire pipeline that
could be relevant to the covered segment. in performing data gathering and integration, an operator must
follow the requirements in asme b31.8s, section 4. operators must begin to integrate all pertinent data
elements specified in this section starting on may 24, 2023, with all available attributes integrated by
february 26, 2024. an operator may request an extension of up to 1 year by submitting a notification to

(2)
use validated information and data as inputs, to the maximum extent practicable. if input is obtained
from subject matter experts (sme), an operator must employ adequate control measures to ensure
consistency and accuracy of information. control measures may include training of smes or the use
of outside technical experts (independent expert reviews) to assess the quality of processes and the
judgment of smes. an operator must document the names and qualifications of the individuals who
approve sme inputs used in the current risk assessment.
(3)
identify and analyze spatial relationships among anomalous information (e.g., corrosion coincident
with foreign line crossings or evidence of pipeline damage where overhead imaging shows evidence
of encroachment).
(4)
analyze the data for interrelationships among pipeline integrity threats, including combinations of
applicable risk factors that increase the likelihood of incidents or increase the potential
consequences of incidents.
(c)
risk assessment. an operator must conduct a risk assessment that follows asme b31.8s, section 5, and
that analyzes the identified threats and potential consequences of an incident for each covered segment.
an operator must ensure the validity of the methods used to conduct the risk assessment considering the
incident, leak, and failure history of the pipeline segments and other historical information. such a
validation must ensure the risk assessment methods produce a risk characterization that is consistent
with the operator's and industry experience, including evaluations of the cause of past incidents, as
determined by root cause analysis or other equivalent means, and include sensitivity analysis of the
factors used to characterize both the likelihood of loss of pipeline integrity and consequences of the
postulated loss of pipeline integrity. an operator must use the risk assessment to determine additional
preventive and mitigative measures needed for each covered segment in accordance with § 192.935 and
periodically evaluate the integrity of each covered pipeline segment in accordance with § 192.937.
beginning february 26, 2024, the risk assessment must:
(1)
analyze how a potential failure could affect high consequence areas;
49 cfr part 192 (up to date as of 2/26/2025)
transportation of natural and other gas by pipeline: minimum federal...
49 cfr 192.917(b)(1)(xxv)
49 cfr 192.917(c)(1) (enhanced display)
page 187 of 235

(2)
analyze the likelihood of failure due to each individual threat and each unique combination of threats
that interact or simultaneously contribute to risk at a common location;
(3)
account for, and compensate for, uncertainties in the model and the data used in the risk
assessment; and
(4)
evaluate the potential risk reduction associated with candidate risk reduction activities, such as
preventive and mitigative measures, and reduced anomaly remediation and assessment intervals.
(5)
in conjunction with § 192.917(b), an operator may request an extension of up to 1 year for the
requirements of this paragraph by submitting a notification to phmsa at least 90 days before
february 26, 2024, in accordance with § 192.18. the notification must include a reasonable and
technically justified basis, an up-to-date plan for completing all actions required by this paragraph
(c)(5), the reason for the requested extension, current safety or mitigation status of the pipeline
segment, the proposed completion date, and any needed temporary safety measures to mitigate the
impact on safety.
(d)
plastic transmission pipeline. an operator of a plastic transmission pipeline must assess the threats to
each covered segment using the information in sections 4 and 5 of asme b31.8s and consider any
threats unique to the integrity of plastic pipe, such as poor joint fusion practices, pipe with poor slow
crack growth (scg) resistance, brittle pipe, circumferential cracking, hydrocarbon softening of the pipe,
internal and external loads, longitudinal or lateral loads, proximity to elevated heat sources, and point
loading.
(e)
actions to address particular threats. if an operator identifies any of the following threats, the operator
must take the following actions to address the threat.
(1)
third party damage. an operator must utilize the data integration required in paragraph (b) of this
section and asme/ansi b31.8s, appendix a-8 to determine the susceptibility of each covered
segment to the threat of third party damage. if an operator identifies the threat of third party
damage, the operator must implement comprehensive additional preventive measures in
accordance with § 192.935 and monitor the effectiveness of the preventive measures. if, in
conducting a baseline assessment under § 192.921, or a reassessment under § 192.937, an
operator uses an internal inspection tool or external corrosion direct assessment, the operator must
integrate data from these assessments with data related to any encroachment or foreign line
crossing on the covered segment, to define where potential indications of third party damage may
exist in the covered segment. an operator must also have procedures in its integrity management
program addressing actions it will take to respond to findings from this data integration.
(2)
cyclic fatigue. an operator must analyze and account for whether cyclic fatigue or other loading
conditions (including ground movement, and suspension bridge condition) could lead to a failure of
a deformation, including a dent or gouge, crack, or other defect in the covered segment. the analysis
must assume the presence of threats in the covered segment that could be exacerbated by cyclic
fatigue. an operator must use the results from the analysis together with the criteria used to
determine the significance of the threat(s) to the covered segment to prioritize the integrity baseline
assessment or reassessment. failure stress pressure and crack growth analysis of cracks and
crack-like defects must be conducted in accordance with § 192.712. an operator must monitor
operating pressure cycles and periodically, but at least every 7 calendar years, with intervals not to
exceed 90 months, determine if the cyclic fatigue analysis remains valid or if the cyclic fatigue
analysis must be revised based on changes to operating pressure cycles or other loading conditions.

page 188 of 235

(3)
manufacturing and construction defects. an operator must analyze the covered segment to
determine and account for the risk of failure from manufacturing and construction defects (including
seam defects) in the covered segment. the analysis must account for the results of prior
assessments on the covered segment. an operator may consider manufacturing and construction
related defects to be stable defects only if the covered segment has been subjected to hydrostatic
pressure testing satisfying the criteria of subpart j of at least 1.25 times maop, and the covered
segment has not experienced a reportable incident attributed to a manufacturing or construction
defect since the date of the most recent subpart j pressure test. if any of the following changes
occur in the covered segment, an operator must prioritize the covered segment as a high-risk
segment for the baseline assessment or a subsequent reassessment.
(i)
the pipeline segment has experienced a reportable incident, as defined in § 191.3, since its
most recent successful subpart j pressure test, due to an original manufacturing-related
defect, or a construction-, installation-, or fabrication-related defect;
(ii)
maop increases; or
(iii) the stresses leading to cyclic fatigue increase.
(4)
electric resistance welded (erw) pipe. if a covered pipeline segment contains low frequency erw
pipe, lap welded pipe, pipe with longitudinal joint factor less than 1.0 as defined in § 192.113, or
other pipe that satisfies the conditions specified in asme b31.8s, appendices a-5.3 and a-5.4, and
any covered or non-covered segment in the pipeline system with such pipe has experienced seam
failure (including seam cracking and selective seam weld corrosion), or operating pressure on the
covered segment has increased over the maximum operating pressure experienced during the
preceding 5 years (including abnormal operation as defined in § 192.605(c)), or maop has been
increased, an operator must select an assessment technology or technologies with a proven
application capable of assessing seam integrity and seam corrosion anomalies. the operator must
prioritize the covered segment as a high-risk segment for the baseline assessment or a subsequent
reassessment. pipe with seam cracks must be evaluated using fracture mechanics modeling for
failure stress pressures and cyclic fatigue crack growth analysis to estimate the remaining life of the
pipe in accordance with § 192.712.
(5)
corrosion. if an operator identifies corrosion on a covered pipeline segment that could adversely
affect the integrity of the line (conditions specified in § 192.933), the operator must evaluate and
remediate, as necessary, all pipeline segments (both covered and non-covered) with similar material
coating and environmental characteristics. an operator must establish a schedule for evaluating and
remediating, as necessary, the similar segments that is consistent with the operator's established
operating and maintenance procedures under part 192 for testing and repair.
(6)
cracks. if an operator identifies any crack or crack-like defect (e.g., stress corrosion cracking or other
environmentally assisted cracking, seam defects, selective seam weld corrosion, girth weld cracks,
hook cracks, and fatigue cracks) on a covered pipeline segment that could adversely affect the
integrity of the pipeline, the operator must evaluate, and remediate, as necessary, all pipeline
segments (both covered and non-covered) with similar characteristics associated with the crack or
crack-like defect. similar characteristics may include operating and maintenance histories, material
properties, and environmental characteristics. an operator must establish a schedule for evaluating,
and remediating, as necessary, the similar pipeline segments that is consistent with the operator's
established operating and maintenance procedures under this part for testing and repair.

a schedule for completing the integrity assessment of all covered segments, including risk factors
considered in establishing the assessment schedule;
(d)
if applicable, a direct assessment plan that meets the requirements of §§ 192.923, and depending on the
threat to be addressed, of § 192.925, § 192.927, or § 192.929; and
(e)
a procedure to ensure that the baseline assessment is being conducted in a manner that minimizes
environmental and safety risks.
(a)
assessment methods. an operator must assess the integrity of the line pipe in each covered segment by
applying one or more of the following methods for each threat to which the covered segment is
susceptible. an operator must select the method or methods best suited to address the threats identified
to the covered segment (see § 192.917).
(1)
internal inspection tool or tools capable of detecting those threats to which the pipeline is
susceptible. the use of internal inspection tools is appropriate for threats such as corrosion,
deformation and mechanical damage (including dents, gouges and grooves), material cracking and
crack-like defects (e.g., stress corrosion cracking, selective seam weld corrosion, environmentally
assisted cracking, and girth weld cracks), hard spots with cracking, and any other threats to which
the covered segment is susceptible. when performing an assessment using an in-line inspection
tool, an operator must comply with § 192.493. in addition, an operator must analyze and account for
uncertainties in reported results (e.g., tool tolerance, detection threshold, probability of detection,
probability of identification, sizing accuracy, conservative anomaly interaction criteria, location
accuracy, anomaly findings, and unity chart plots or equivalent for determining uncertainties and
verifying actual tool performance) in identifying and characterizing anomalies;
(2)
pressure test conducted in accordance with subpart j of this part. the use of subpart j pressure
testing is appropriate for threats such as internal corrosion; external corrosion and other
environmentally assisted corrosion mechanisms; manufacturing and related defects threats,
including defective pipe and pipe seams; stress corrosion cracking; selective seam weld corrosion;
dents; and other forms of mechanical damage. an operator must use the test pressures specified in
specified in table 5.6.1-1 of section 5 of asme b31.8s (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7) to
justify an extended reassessment interval in accordance with § 192.939.

(3)
spike hydrostatic pressure test conducted in accordance with § 192.506. the use of spike
hydrostatic pressure testing is appropriate for time-dependent threats such as stress corrosion
cracking; selective seam weld corrosion; manufacturing and related defects, including defective pipe
and pipe seams; and other forms of defect or damage involving cracks or crack-like defects;
(4)
excavation and in situ direct examination by means of visual examination, direct measurement, and
recorded non-destructive examination results and data needed to assess all threats. based upon the
threat assessed, examples of appropriate non-destructive examination methods include ultrasonic
testing (ut), phased array ultrasonic testing (paut), inverse wave field extrapolation (iwex),
radiography, and magnetic particle inspection (mpi);
(5)
guided wave ultrasonic testing (gwut) as described in appendix f. the use of gwut is appropriate
for internal and external pipe wall loss;
(6)
direct assessment to address threats of external corrosion, internal corrosion, and stress corrosion
cracking. the use of direct assessment to address threats of external corrosion, internal corrosion,
and stress corrosion cracking is allowed only if appropriate for the threat and the pipeline segment
being assessed. use of direct assessment for threats other than the threat for which the direct
assessment method is suitable is not allowed. an operator must conduct the direct assessment in
accordance with the requirements listed in § 192.923 and with the applicable requirements specified
in §§ 192.925, 192.927 and 192.929; or
(7)
other technology that an operator demonstrates can provide an equivalent understanding of the
condition of the line pipe for each of the threats to which the pipeline is susceptible. an operator
must notify phmsa in advance of using the other technology in accordance with § 192.18.
(b)
prioritizing segments. an operator must prioritize the covered pipeline segments for the baseline
assessment according to a risk analysis that considers the potential threats to each covered segment.
the risk analysis must comply with the requirements in § 192.917.
(c)
assessment for particular threats. in choosing an assessment method for the baseline assessment of
each covered segment, an operator must take the actions required in § 192.917(e) to address particular
threats that it has identified.
(d)
time period. an operator must prioritize all the covered segments for assessment in accordance with §
192.917 (c) and paragraph (b) of this section. an operator must assess at least 50% of the covered
segments beginning with the highest risk segments, by december 17, 2007. an operator must complete
the baseline assessment of all covered segments by december 17, 2012.
(e)
prior assessment. an operator may use a prior integrity assessment conducted before december 17, 2002
as a baseline assessment for the covered segment, if the integrity assessment meets the baseline
requirements in this subpart and subsequent remedial actions to address the conditions listed in §
192.933 have been carried out. in addition, if an operator uses this prior assessment as its baseline
assessment, the operator must reassess the line pipe in the covered segment according to the
requirements of § 192.937 and § 192.939.
(f)
newly identified areas. when an operator identifies a new high consequence area (see § 192.905), an
operator must complete the baseline assessment of the line pipe in the newly identified high
consequence area within ten (10) years from the date the area is identified.

pipe covered by this subpart within ten (10) years from the date the pipe is installed. an operator may
conduct a pressure test in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section, to satisfy the requirement for
a baseline assessment.
(h)
plastic transmission pipeline. if the threat analysis required in § 192.917(d) on a plastic transmission
pipeline indicates that a covered segment is susceptible to failure from causes other than third-party
damage, an operator must conduct a baseline assessment of the segment in accordance with the
requirements of this section and of § 192.917. the operator must justify the use of an alternative
assessment method that will address the identified threats to the covered segment.
(i)
baseline assessments for pipeline segments with a reconfirmed maop. an integrity assessment conducted
in accordance with the requirements of § 192.624(c) may be used as a baseline assessment under this
section.
(a)
general. an operator may use direct assessment either as a primary assessment method or as a
supplement to the other assessment methods allowed under this subpart. an operator may only use
direct assessment as the primary assessment method to address the identified threats of external
corrosion (ec), internal corrosion (ic), and stress corrosion cracking (scc).
(b)
primary method. an operator using direct assessment as a primary assessment method must have a plan
that complies with the requirements in—
(1)
section 192.925 and asme b31.8s (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7) section 6.4, and nace
sp0502 (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7) , if addressing external corrosion (ec).

(b)
general requirements. an operator that uses direct assessment to assess the threat of external corrosion
must follow the requirements in this section, in asme b31.8s (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7),
section 6.4, and in nace sp0502 (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7). an operator must develop and
implement a direct assessment plan that has procedures addressing pre-assessment, indirect inspection,
direct examination, and post assessment. if the ecda detects pipeline coating damage, the operator
must also integrate the data from the ecda with other information from the data integration (§
192.917(b)) to evaluate the covered segment for the threat of third party damage and to address the
threat as required by § 192.917(e)(1).
(1)
preassessment. in addition to the requirements in asme b31.8s section 6.4 and nace sp0502,
section 3, the plan's procedures for preassessment must include—
(i)
provisions for applying more restrictive criteria when conducting ecda for the first time on a
covered segment; and
(ii)
the basis on which an operator selects at least two different, but complementary indirect
assessment tools to assess each ecda region. if an operator utilizes an indirect inspection
method that is not discussed in appendix a of nace sp0502, the operator must demonstrate
the applicability, validation basis, equipment used, application procedure, and utilization of data
for the inspection method.
(2)
indirect inspection. in addition to the requirements in asme b31.8s, section 6.4 and in nace sp0502,
section 4, the plan's procedures for indirect inspection of the ecda regions must include—
(i)
provisions for applying more restrictive criteria when conducting ecda for the first time on a
covered segment;
(ii)
criteria for identifying and documenting those indications that must be considered for
excavation and direct examination. minimum identification criteria include the known
sensitivities of assessment tools, the procedures for using each tool, and the approach to be
used for decreasing the physical spacing of indirect assessment tool readings when the
presence of a defect is suspected;
(iii) criteria for defining the urgency of excavation and direct examination of each indication
identified during the indirect examination. these criteria must specify how an operator will
define the urgency of excavating the indication as immediate, scheduled or monitored; and
(iv) criteria for scheduling excavation of indications for each urgency level.

§ 192.927 what are the requirements for using internal corrosion direct assessment (icda)?
(iii) criteria and notification procedures for any changes in the ecda plan, including changes that
affect the severity classification, the priority of direct examination, and the time frame for direct
examination of indications; and
(iv) criteria that describe how and on what basis an operator will reclassify and reprioritize any of
the provisions that are specified in section 5.9 of nace sp0502.
(4)
post assessment and continuing evaluation. in addition to the requirements in asme b31.8s section
6.4 and nace sp0502, section 6, the plan's procedures for post assessment of the effectiveness of
the ecda process must include—
(i)
measures for evaluating the long-term effectiveness of ecda in addressing external corrosion
in covered segments; and
(ii)
criteria for evaluating whether conditions discovered by direct examination of indications in
each ecda region indicate a need for reassessment of the covered segment at an interval less
than that specified in § 192.939. (see appendix d of nace sp0502.)
(a)
definition. internal corrosion direct assessment (icda) is a process an operator uses to identify areas
along the pipeline where fluid or other electrolyte introduced during normal operation or by an upset
condition may reside, and then focuses direct examination on the locations in covered segments where
internal corrosion is most likely to exist. the process identifies the potential for internal corrosion caused
by microorganisms, or fluid with co2, o2, hydrogen sulfide or other contaminants present in the gas.
(b)
general requirements. an operator using direct assessment as an assessment method to address internal
corrosion in a covered pipeline segment must follow the requirements in this section and in nace
sp0206 (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7). the dry gas internal corrosion direct assessment (dg-
icda) process described in this section applies only for a segment of pipe transporting normally dry
natural gas (see § 192.3) and not for a segment with electrolytes normally present in the gas stream. if an
operator uses icda to assess a covered segment operating with electrolytes present in the gas stream,
the operator must develop a plan that demonstrates how it will conduct icda in the segment to address
internal corrosion effectively and must notify phmsa in accordance with § 192.18. in the event of a
conflict between this section and nace sp0206, the requirements in this section control.
(c)
the icda plan. an operator must develop and follow an icda plan that meets nace sp0206 (incorporated
by reference, see § 192.7) and that implements all four steps of the dg-icda process, including pre-
assessment, indirect inspection, detailed examination at excavation locations, and post-assessment
evaluation and monitoring. the plan must identify the locations of all icda regions within covered
segments in the transmission system. an icda region is a continuous length of pipe (including weld
joints), uninterrupted by any significant change in water or flow characteristics, that includes similar
physical characteristics or operating history. an icda region extends from the location where liquid may
first enter the pipeline and encompasses the entire area along the pipeline where internal corrosion may
occur until a new input introduces the possibility of water entering the pipeline. in cases where a single

page 194 of 235

covered segment is partially located in two or more icda regions, the four-step icda process must be
completed for each icda region in which the covered segment is partially located to complete the
assessment of the covered segment.
(1)
preassessment. an operator must comply with nace sp0206 (incorporated by reference, see §
192.7) in conducting the preassessment step of the icda process.
(2)
indirect inspection. an operator must comply with nace sp0206 (incorporated by reference, see §
192.7), and the following additional requirements, in conducting the indirect inspection step of the
icda process. an operator must explicitly document the results of its feasibility assessment as
required by nace sp0206, section 3.3 (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7); if any condition that
precludes the successful application of icda applies, then icda may not be used, and another
assessment method must be selected. when performing the indirect inspection, the operator must
use actual pipeline-specific data, exclusively. the use of assumed pipeline or operational data is
prohibited. when calculating the critical inclination angle of liquid holdup and the inclination profile
of the pipeline, the operator must consider the accuracy, reliability, and uncertainty of the data used
to make those calculations, including, but not limited to, gas flow velocity (including during upset
conditions), pipeline elevation profile survey data (including specific profile at features with
inclinations such as road crossings, river crossings, drains, valves, drips, etc.), topographical data,
and depth of cover. an operator must select locations for direct examination and establish the
extent of pipe exposure needed (i.e., the size of the bell hole), to account for these uncertainties and
their cumulative effect on the precise location of predicted liquid dropout.
(3)
detailed examination. an operator must comply with nace sp0206 (incorporated by reference, see §
192.7) in conducting the detailed examination step of the icda process. when an operator first uses
icda for a covered segment, an operator must identify a minimum of two locations for excavation
within each covered segment associated with the icda region and must perform a detailed
examination for internal corrosion at each location using ultrasonic thickness measurements,
radiography, or other generally accepted measurement techniques that can examine for internal
corrosion or other threats that are being assessed. one location must be the low point (e.g., sag,
drip, valve, manifold, dead-leg) within the covered segment nearest to the beginning of the icda
region. the second location must be further downstream, within the covered segment, near the end
of the icda region. whenever corrosion is found during icda at any location, the operator must:
(i)
evaluate the severity of the defect (remaining strength) and remediate the defect in accordance
with § 192.933 if the condition is in a covered segment, or in accordance with §§ 192.485 and
192.714 if the condition is not in a covered segment;
(ii)
expand the detailed examination program to determine all locations that have internal corrosion
within the icda region, and accurately characterize the nature, extent, and root cause of the
internal corrosion. in cases where the internal corrosion was identified within the icda region
but outside the covered segment, the expanded detailed examination program must also
include at least two detailed examinations within each covered segment associated with the
icda region, at the location within the covered segment(s) most likely to have internal
corrosion. one location must be the low point (e.g., sags, drips, valves, manifolds, dead-legs,
traps) within the covered segment nearest to the beginning of the icda region. the second
location must be further downstream, within the covered segment. in instances of first use of
icda for a covered segment, where these locations have already been examined in accordance
with paragraph (c)(3) of this section, two additional detailed examinations must be conducted
within the covered segment; and

(iii) expand the detailed examination program to evaluate the potential for internal corrosion in all
pipeline segments (both covered and non-covered) in the operator's pipeline system with
similar characteristics to the icda region in which the corrosion was found and remediate
identified instances of internal corrosion in accordance with either § 192.933 or §§ 192.485
and 192.714, as appropriate.
(4)
post-assessment evaluation and monitoring. an operator must comply with nace sp0206
(incorporated by reference, see § 192.7) in performing the post assessment step of the icda
process. in addition to nace sp0206, the evaluation and monitoring process must also include—
(i)
an evaluation of the effectiveness of icda as an assessment method for addressing internal
corrosion and determining whether a covered segment should be reassessed at more frequent
intervals than those specified in § 192.939. an operator must carry out this evaluation within 1
year of conducting an icda;
(ii)
validation of the flow modeling calculations by comparison of actual locations of discovered
internal corrosion with locations predicted by the model (if the flow model cannot be validated,
then icda is not feasible for the segment); and
(iii) continuous monitoring of each icda region that contains a covered segment where internal
corrosion has been identified by using techniques such as coupons or ultrasonic (ut) sensors
or electronic probes, and by periodically drawing off liquids at low points and chemically
analyzing the liquids for the presence of corrosion products. an operator must base the
frequency of the monitoring and liquid analysis on results from all integrity assessments that
have been conducted in accordance with the requirements of this subpart and risk factors
specific to the icda region. at a minimum, the monitoring frequency must be two times each
calendar year, but at intervals not exceeding 71⁄2 months. if an operator finds any evidence of
corrosion products in the icda region, the operator must take prompt action in accordance with
one of the two following required actions, and remediate the conditions the operator finds in
accordance with § 192.933 or §§ 192.485 and 192.714, as applicable.
(a)
conduct excavations of, and detailed examinations at, locations downstream from where
the electrolytes might have entered the pipe to investigate and accurately characterize the
nature, extent, and root cause of the corrosion; or
(b)
assess the covered segment using another integrity assessment method allowed by this
subpart.
(5)
other requirements. the icda plan must also include the following:
(i)
criteria an operator will apply in making key decisions (including, but not limited to, icda
feasibility, definition of icda regions and sub-regions, and conditions requiring excavation) in
implementing each stage of the icda process; and
(ii)
provisions that the analysis be carried out on the entire pipeline in which covered segments are
present, except that application of the remediation criteria of § 192.933 may be limited to
covered segments.

§ 192.929 what are the requirements for using direct assessment for stress corrosion
cracking?
(a)
definition. a stress corrosion cracking direct assessment (sccda) is a process to assess a covered
pipeline segment for the presence of stress corrosion cracking (scc) by systematically gathering and
analyzing excavation data from pipe having similar operational characteristics and residing in a similar
physical environment.
(b)
general requirements. an operator using direct assessment as an integrity assessment method for
addressing scc in a covered pipeline segment must develop and follow an sccda plan that meets nace
sp0204 (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7) and that implements all four steps of the sccda
process, including pre-assessment, indirect inspection, detailed examination at excavation locations, and
post-assessment evaluation and monitoring. as specified in nace sp0204, sccda is complementary
with other inspection methods for scc, such as in-line inspection or hydrostatic testing with a spike test,
and it is not necessarily an alternative or replacement for these methods in all instances. additionally, the
plan must provide for—
(1)
data gathering and integration. an operator's plan must provide for a systematic process to collect
and evaluate data for all covered pipeline segments to identify whether the conditions for scc are
present and to prioritize the covered pipeline segments for assessment in accordance with nace
sp0204, sections 3 and 4, and table 1 (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7). this process must
also include gathering and evaluating data related to scc at all sites an operator excavates while
conducting its pipeline operations (both within and outside covered segments) where the criteria in
nace sp0204 (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7) indicate the potential for scc. this data
gathering process must be conducted in accordance with nace sp0204, section 5.3 (incorporated
by reference, see § 192.7), and must include, at a minimum, all data listed in nace sp0204, table 2
(incorporated by reference, see § 192.7). further, the following factors must be analyzed as part of
this evaluation:
(i)
the effects of a carbonate-bicarbonate environment, including the implications of any factors
that promote the production of a carbonate-bicarbonate environment, such as soil temperature,
moisture, the presence or generation of carbon dioxide, or cathodic protection (cp);
(ii)
the effects of cyclic loading conditions on the susceptibility and propagation of scc in both
high-ph and near-neutral-ph environments;
(iii) the effects of variations in applied cp, such as overprotection, cp loss for extended periods,
and high negative potentials;
(iv) the effects of coatings that shield cp when disbonded from the pipe; and
(v)
other factors that affect the mechanistic properties associated with scc, including, but not
limited to, historical and present-day operating pressures, high tensile residual stresses, flowing
product temperatures, and the presence of sulfides.
(2)
indirect inspection. in addition to nace sp0204, the plan's procedures for indirect inspection must
include provisions for conducting at least two above ground surveys using the complementary
measurement tools most appropriate for the pipeline segment based on an evaluation of integrated
data.

page 197 of 235

(3)
direct examination. in addition to nace sp0204, the plan's procedures for direct examination must
provide for an operator conducting a minimum of three direct examinations for scc within the
covered pipeline segment spaced at the locations determined to be the most likely for scc to occur.
(4)
remediation and mitigation. if scc is discovered in a covered pipeline segment, an operator must
mitigate the threat in accordance with one of the following applicable methods:
(i)
removing the pipe with scc; remediating the pipe with a type b sleeve; performing hydrostatic
testing in accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section; or by grinding out the scc defect
and repairing the pipe. if an operator uses grinding for repair, the operator must also perform
the following as a part of the repair procedure: nondestructive testing for any remaining cracks
or other defects; a measurement of the remaining wall thickness; and a determination of the
remaining strength of the pipe at the repair location that is performed in accordance with §
192.712 and that meets the design requirements of §§ 192.111 and 192.112, as applicable.
the pipe and material properties an operator uses in remaining strength calculations must be
documented in traceable, verifiable, and complete records. if such records are not available, an
operator must base the pipe and material properties used in the remaining strength
calculations on properties determined and documented in accordance with § 192.607, if
applicable.
(ii)
performing a spike pressure test in accordance with § 192.506 based upon the class location
of the pipeline segment. the maop must be no greater than the test pressure specified in §
192.506(a) divided by: 1.39 for class 1 locations and class 2 locations that contain class 1
pipe that has been uprated in accordance with § 192.611; and 1.50 for all other class 2
locations and all class 3 and class 4 locations. an operator must repair any test failures due to
scc by replacing the pipe segment and re-testing the segment until the pipe passes the test
without failures (such as pipe seam or gasket leaks, or a pipe rupture). at a minimum, an
operator must repair pipe segments that pass the pressure test but have scc present by
grinding the segment in accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section.
(5)
post assessment. an operator's procedures for post-assessment, in addition to the procedures listed
in nace sp0204, sections 6.3, “periodic reassessment,” and 6.4, “effectiveness of sccda,” must
include the development of a reassessment plan based on the susceptibility of the operator's pipe to
scc as well as the mechanistic behavior of identified cracking. an operator's reassessment intervals
must comply with § 192.939. the plan must include the following factors, in addition to any factors
the operator determines appropriate:
(i)
the evaluation of discovered crack clusters during the direct examination step in accordance
with nace sp0204, sections 5.3.5.7, 5.4, and 5.5 (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7);
(ii)
conditions conducive to the creation of a carbonate-bicarbonate environment;
(iii) conditions in the application (or loss) of cp that can create or exacerbate scc;
(iv) operating temperature and pressure conditions, including operating stress levels on the pipe;
(v)
cyclic loading conditions;
(vi) mechanistic conditions that influence crack initiation and growth rates;
(vii) the effects of interacting crack clusters;
(viii) the presence of sulfides; and

§ 192.931 how may confirmatory direct assessment (cda) be used?
an operator using the confirmatory direct assessment (cda) method as allowed in § 192.937 must have a plan that
meets the requirements of this section and of §§ 192.925 (ecda) and § 192.927 (icda).
[68 fr 69817, dec. 15, 2003, as amended by amdt. 192-114, 75 fr 48604, aug. 11, 2010; amdt. 192-119, 80 fr 178, jan. 5, 2015]
§ 192.933 what actions must be taken to address integrity issues?
(ix) disbonded coatings that shield cp from the pipe.
(a)
threats. an operator may only use cda on a covered segment to identify damage resulting from external
corrosion or internal corrosion.
(b)
external corrosion plan. an operator's cda plan for identifying external corrosion must comply with §
192.925 with the following exceptions.
(1)
the procedures for indirect examination may allow use of only one indirect examination tool suitable
for the application.
(2)
the procedures for direct examination and remediation must provide that—
(i)
all immediate action indications must be excavated for each ecda region; and
(ii)
at least one high risk indication that meets the criteria of scheduled action must be excavated
in each ecda region.
(c)
internal corrosion plan. an operator's cda plan for identifying internal corrosion must comply with §
192.927 except that the plan's procedures for identifying locations for excavation may require excavation
of only one high risk location in each icda region.
(d)
defects requiring near-term remediation. if an assessment carried out under paragraph (b) or (c) of this
section reveals any defect requiring remediation prior to the next scheduled assessment, the operator
must schedule the next assessment in accordance with nace sp0502 (incorporated by reference, see §
192.7), section 6.2 and 6.3. if the defect requires immediate remediation, then the operator must reduce
pressure consistent with § 192.933 until the operator has completed reassessment using one of the
assessment techniques allowed in § 192.937.
(a)
general requirements. an operator must take prompt action to address all anomalous conditions the
operator discovers through the integrity assessment. in addressing all conditions, an operator must
evaluate all anomalous conditions and remediate those that could reduce a pipeline's integrity. an
operator must be able to demonstrate that the remediation of the condition will ensure the condition is
unlikely to pose a threat to the integrity of the pipeline until the next reassessment of the covered
segment. repairs performed in accordance with this section must use pipe and material properties that
are documented in traceable, verifiable, and complete records. if documented data required for any
analysis is not available, an operator must obtain the undocumented data through § 192.607. until
documented material properties are available, the operator must use the conservative assumptions in
either § 192.712(e)(2) or, if appropriate following a pressure test, in § 192.712(d)(3).
(1)
temporary pressure reduction.

(i)
if an operator is unable to respond within the time limits for certain conditions specified in this
section, the operator must temporarily reduce the operating pressure of the pipeline or take
other action that ensures the safety of the covered segment. an operator must reduce the
operating pressure to one of the following:
(a)
a level not exceeding 80 percent of the operating pressure at the time the condition was
discovered;
(b)
a level not exceeding the predicted failure pressure times the design factor for the class
location in which the affected pipeline is located; or
(c)
a level not exceeding the predicted failure pressure divided by 1.1.
(ii)
an operator must determine the predicted failure pressure in accordance with § 192.712. an
operator must notify phmsa in accordance with § 192.18 if it cannot meet the schedule for
evaluation and remediation required under paragraph (c) or (d) of this section and cannot
provide safety through a temporary reduction in operating pressure or other action. the
operator must document and keep records of the calculations and decisions used to determine
the reduced operating pressure, and the implementation of the actual reduced operating
pressure, for a period of 5 years after the pipeline has been remediated.
(2)
long-term pressure reduction. when a pressure reduction exceeds 365 days, an operator must notify
phmsa under § 192.18 and explain the reasons for the remediation delay. this notice must include
a technical justification that the continued pressure reduction will not jeopardize the integrity of the
pipeline.
(b)
discovery of condition. discovery of a condition occurs when an operator has adequate information about
a condition to determine that the condition presents a potential threat to the integrity of the pipeline. for
the purposes of this section, a condition that presents a potential threat includes, but is not limited to,
those conditions that require remediation or monitoring listed under paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this
section. an operator must promptly, but no later than 180 days after conducting an integrity assessment,
obtain sufficient information about a condition to make that determination, unless the operator
demonstrates that the 180-day period is impracticable. in cases where a determination is not made within
the 180-day period, the operator must notify phmsa, in accordance with § 192.18, and provide an
expected date when adequate information will become available. notification to phmsa does not
alleviate an operator from the discovery requirements of this paragraph (b).
(c)
schedule for evaluation and remediation. an operator must complete remediation of a condition according
to a schedule prioritizing the conditions for evaluation and remediation. unless a special requirement for
remediating certain conditions applies, as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, an operator must
follow the schedule in asme b31.8s (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7), section 7, figure 7.2.1-1. if
an operator cannot meet the schedule for any condition, the operator must explain the reasons why it
cannot meet the schedule and how the changed schedule will not jeopardize public safety.
(d)
special requirements for scheduling remediation —
(1)
immediate repair conditions. an operator's evaluation and remediation schedule must follow asme/
ansi b31.8s-2004, section 7 (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7) in providing for immediate
repair conditions. to maintain safety, an operator must temporarily reduce operating pressure in
accordance with paragraph (a) of this section or shut down the pipeline until the operator completes
the repair of these conditions. an operator must treat the following conditions as immediate repair
conditions:

depth.
(vi) an indication or anomaly that, in the judgment of the person designated by the operator to
evaluate the assessment results, requires immediate action.
(2)
one-year conditions. except for conditions listed in paragraphs (d)(1) and (3) of this section, an
operator must remediate any of the following within 1 year of discovery of the condition:
(i)
a smooth dent located between the 8 o'clock and 4 o'clock positions (upper 2⁄3 of the pipe) with
a depth greater than 6 percent of the pipeline diameter (greater than 0.50 inches in depth for a
pipeline diameter less than nominal pipe size (nps) 12), unless engineering analyses
performed in accordance with § 192.712(c) demonstrate critical strain levels are not exceeded.
(ii)
a dent with a depth greater than 2 percent of the pipeline diameter (0.250 inches in depth for a
pipeline diameter less than nps 12) that affects pipe curvature at a girth weld or at a
longitudinal or helical (spiral) seam weld, unless engineering analyses performed in accordance
with § 192.712(c) demonstrate critical strain levels are not exceeded.
(iii) a dent located between the 4 o'clock and 8 o'clock positions (lower 1⁄3 of the pipe) that has
metal loss, cracking, or a stress riser, unless engineering analyses performed in accordance
with § 192.712(c) demonstrate critical strain levels are not exceeded.
(iv) metal loss anomalies where a calculation of the remaining strength of the pipe at the location
of the anomaly shows a predicted failure pressure, determined in accordance with §
192.712(b), less than 1.39 times the maop for class 2 locations, and less than 1.50 times the
maop for class 3 and 4 locations. for metal loss anomalies in class 1 locations with a
predicted failure pressure greater than 1.1 times maop, an operator must follow the
remediation schedule specified in asme b31.8s (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7),
section 7, figure 4, in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
(v)
metal loss that is located at a crossing of another pipeline, or is in an area with widespread
circumferential corrosion, or could affect a girth weld, that has a predicted failure pressure,

class 1 locations or where class 2 locations contain class 1 pipe that has been uprated in
accordance with § 192.611, or less than 1.50 times the maop for all other class 2 locations
and all class 3 and 4 locations.
(vii) a crack or crack-like anomaly that has a predicted failure pressure, determined in accordance
with § 192.712(d), that is less than 1.39 times the maop for class 1 locations or where class 2

1.50 times the maop for all other class 2 locations and all class 3 and 4 locations.
(3)
monitored conditions. an operator is not required by this section to schedule remediation of the
following less severe conditions but must record and monitor the conditions during subsequent risk
assessments and integrity assessments for any change that may require remediation. monitored
indications are the least severe and do not require an operator to examine and evaluate them until
the next scheduled integrity assessment interval, but if an anomaly is expected to grow to
dimensions or have a predicted failure pressure (with a safety factor) meeting a 1-year condition
prior to the next scheduled assessment, then the operator must repair the condition:
(i)
a dent with a depth greater than 6 percent of the pipeline diameter (greater than 0.50 inches in
depth for a pipeline diameter less than nps 12), located between the 4 o'clock position and the
8 o'clock position (bottom 1⁄3 of the pipe), and for which engineering analyses of the dent,

§ 192.935 what additional preventive and mitigative measures must an operator take?
(vi) a crack or crack-like anomaly for which the predicted failure pressure, determined in
accordance with § 192.712(d), is greater than or equal to 1.39 times the maop for class 1
locations or where class 2 locations contain class 1 pipe that has been uprated in accordance
with § 192.611, or greater than or equal to 1.50 times the maop for all other class 2 locations
and all class 3 and 4 locations.
(e)
in situ direct examination of crack defects. whenever an operator finds conditions that require the pipeline
to be repaired, in accordance with this section, an operator must perform a direct examination of known
locations of cracks or crack-like defects using technology that has been validated to detect tight cracks
(equal to or less than 0.008 inches crack opening), such as inverse wave field extrapolation (iwex),
phased array ultrasonic testing (paut), ultrasonic testing (ut), or equivalent technology. “in situ”
examination tools and procedures for crack assessments (length, depth, and volumetric) must have
performance and evaluation standards, including pipe or weld surface cleanliness standards for the
inspection, confirmed by subject matter experts qualified by knowledge, training, and experience in direct
examination inspection for accuracy of the type of defects and pipe material being evaluated. the
procedures must account for inaccuracies in evaluations and fracture mechanics models for failure
pressure determinations.
(a)
general requirements.
(1)
an operator must take additional measures beyond those already required by this part to prevent a
pipeline failure and to mitigate the consequences of a pipeline failure in a high consequence area.
such additional measures must be based on the risk analyses required by § 192.917. measures that
operators must consider in the analysis, if necessary, to prevent or mitigate the consequences of a
pipeline failure include, but are not limited to:
(i)
correcting the root causes of past incidents to prevent recurrence;
(ii)
establishing and implementing adequate operations and maintenance processes that could
increase safety;
(iii) establishing and deploying adequate resources for the successful execution of preventive and
mitigative measures;
(iv) installing automatic shut-off valves or remote-control valves;
(v)
installing pressure transmitters on both sides of automatic shut-off valves and remote-control
valves that communicate with the pipeline control center;
(vi) installing computerized monitoring and leak detection systems;
(vii) replacing pipe segments with pipe of heavier wall thickness or higher strength;
(viii) conducting additional right-of-way patrols;
(ix) conducting hydrostatic tests in areas where pipe material has quality issues or lost records;

page 203 of 235

(x)
testing to determine material mechanical and chemical properties for unknown properties that
are needed to assure integrity or substantiate maop evaluations, including material property
tests from removed pipe that is representative of the in-service pipeline;
(xi) re-coating damaged, poorly performing, or disbonded coatings;
(xii) performing additional depth-of-cover surveys at roads, streams, and rivers;
(xiii) remediating inadequate depth-of-cover;
(xiv) providing additional training to personnel on response procedures and conducting drills with
local emergency responders; and
(xv) implementing additional inspection and maintenance programs.
(2)
operators must document the risk analysis, the preventive and mitigative measures considered, and
the basis for implementing or not implementing any preventive and mitigative measures considered,
in accordance with § 192.947(d).
(b)
third party damage and outside force damage—
(1)
third party damage. an operator must enhance its damage prevention program, as required under §
192.614 of this part, with respect to a covered segment to prevent and minimize the consequences
of a release due to third party damage. enhanced measures to an existing damage prevention
program include, at a minimum—
(i)
using qualified personnel (see § 192.915) for work an operator is conducting that could
adversely affect the integrity of a covered segment, such as marking, locating, and direct
supervision of known excavation work.
(ii)
collecting in a central database information that is location specific on excavation damage that
occurs in covered and non covered segments in the transmission system and the root cause
analysis to support identification of targeted additional preventative and mitigative measures in
the high consequence areas. this information must include recognized damage that is not
required to be reported as an incident under part 191.
(iii) participating in one-call systems in locations where covered segments are present.
(iv) monitoring of excavations conducted on covered pipeline segments by pipeline personnel. if an
operator finds physical evidence of encroachment involving excavation that the operator did
not monitor near a covered segment, an operator must either excavate the area near the
encroachment or conduct an above ground survey using methods defined in nace sp0502
(incorporated by reference, see § 192.7). an operator must excavate, and remediate, in
accordance with asme b31.8s and § 192.933 any indication of coating holidays or
discontinuity warranting direct examination.
(2)
outside force damage. if an operator determines that outside force (e.g., earth movement, loading,
longitudinal, or lateral forces, seismicity of the area, floods, unstable suspension bridge) is a threat
to the integrity of a covered segment, the operator must take measures to minimize the
consequences to the covered segment from outside force damage. these measures include
increasing the frequency of aerial, foot or other methods of patrols; adding external protection;
reducing external stress; relocating the line; or inline inspections with geospatial and deformation
tools.

§ 192.937 what is a continual process of evaluation and assessment to maintain a pipeline's
integrity?
(c)
risk analysis for gas releases and protection against ruptures. if an operator determines, based on a risk
analysis, that a rupture-mitigation valve (rmv) or alternative equivalent technology would be an efficient
means of adding protection to a high-consequence area (hca) in the event of a gas release, an operator
must install the rmv or alternative equivalent technology. in making that determination, an operator must,
at least, evaluate the following factors—timing of leak detection and pipe shutdown capabilities, the type
of gas being transported, operating pressure, the rate of potential release, pipeline profile, the potential for
ignition, and location of nearest response personnel. an rmv or alternative equivalent technology
installed under this paragraph must meet all of the other applicable requirements in this part.
(d)
pipelines operating below 30% smys. an operator of a transmission pipeline operating below 30% smys
located in a high consequence area must follow the requirements in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this
section. an operator of a transmission pipeline operating below 30% smys located in a class 3 or class 4
area but not in a high consequence area must follow the requirements in paragraphs (d)(1), (d)(2) and
(d)(3) of this section.
(1)
apply the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (b)(1)(iii) of this section to the pipeline; and
(2)
either monitor excavations near the pipeline, or conduct patrols as required by § 192.705 of the
pipeline at bi-monthly intervals. if an operator finds any indication of unreported construction activity,
the operator must conduct a follow up investigation to determine if mechanical damage has
occurred.
(3)
perform instrumented leak surveys using leak detector equipment at least twice each calendar year,
at intervals not exceeding 71⁄2 months. for unprotected pipelines or cathodically protected pipe
where electrical surveys are impractical, instrumented leak surveys must be performed at least four
times each calendar year, at intervals not exceeding 41⁄2 months. electrical surveys are indirect
assessments that include close interval surveys, alternating current voltage gradient surveys, direct
current voltage gradient surveys, or their equivalent.
(e)
plastic transmission pipeline. an operator of a plastic transmission pipeline must apply the requirements
in paragraphs (b)(1)(i), (b)(1)(iii) and (b)(1)(iv) of this section to the covered segments of the pipeline.
(f)
periodic evaluations. risk analyses and assessments conducted under paragraph (c) of this section must
be reviewed by the operator and certified by a senior executive of the company, for operational matters
that could affect rupture-mitigation processes and procedures. review and certification must occur once
per calendar year, with the period between reviews not to exceed 15 months, and must also occur within 3
months of an incident or safety-related condition, as those terms are defined at §§ 191.3 and 191.23,
respectively.
(a)
general. after completing the baseline integrity assessment of a covered segment, an operator must
continue to assess the line pipe of that segment at the intervals specified in § 192.939 and periodically
evaluate the integrity of each covered pipeline segment as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. an
operator must reassess a covered segment on which a prior assessment is credited as a baseline under §
49 cfr part 192 (up to date as of 2/26/2025)

page 205 of 235

192.921(e) by no later than december 17, 2009. an operator must reassess a covered segment on which
a baseline assessment is conducted during the baseline period specified in § 192.921(d) by no later than
seven years after the baseline assessment of that covered segment unless the evaluation under
paragraph (b) of this section indicates earlier reassessment.
(b)
evaluation. an operator must conduct a periodic evaluation as frequently as needed to assure the integrity
of each covered segment. the periodic evaluation must be based on a data integration and risk
assessment of the entire pipeline as specified in § 192.917. for plastic transmission pipelines, the
periodic evaluation is based on the threat analysis specified in 192.917(d). for all other transmission
pipelines, the evaluation must consider the past and present integrity assessment results, data integration
and risk assessment information (§ 192.917), and decisions about remediation (§ 192.933) and
additional preventive and mitigative actions (§ 192.935). an operator must use the results from this
evaluation to identify the threats specific to each covered segment and the risk represented by these
threats.
(c)
assessment methods. in conducting the integrity reassessment, an operator must assess the integrity of
the line pipe in each covered segment by applying one or more of the following methods for each threat to
which the covered segment is susceptible. an operator must select the method or methods best suited to
address the threats identified on the covered segment (see § 192.917).
(1)
internal inspection tools. when performing an assessment using an in-line inspection tool, an
operator must comply with the following requirements:
(i)
perform the in-line inspection in accordance with § 192.493;
(ii)
select a tool or combination of tools capable of detecting the threats to which the pipeline
segment is susceptible such as corrosion, deformation and mechanical damage (e.g. dents,
gouges and grooves), material cracking and crack-like defects (e.g. stress corrosion cracking,
selective seam weld corrosion, environmentally assisted cracking, and girth weld cracks), hard
spots with cracking, and any other threats to which the covered segment is susceptible; and
(iii) analyze and account for uncertainties in reported results (e.g., tool tolerance, detection
threshold, probability of detection, probability of identification, sizing accuracy, conservative
anomaly interaction criteria, location accuracy, anomaly findings, and unity chart plots or
equivalent for determining uncertainties and verifying actual tool performance) in identifying
and characterizing anomalies.
(2)
pressure test conducted in accordance with subpart j of this part. the use of pressure testing is
appropriate for threats such as: internal corrosion; external corrosion and other environmentally
assisted corrosion mechanisms; manufacturing and related defects threats, including defective pipe
and pipe seams; stress corrosion cracking; selective seam weld corrosion; dents; and other forms of
mechanical damage. an operator must use the test pressures specified in table 5.6.1-1 of section 5
of asme b31.8s (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7) to justify an extended reassessment
interval in accordance with § 192.939.
(3)
spike hydrostatic pressure test in accordance with § 192.506. the use of spike hydrostatic pressure
testing is appropriate for time-dependent threats such as: stress corrosion cracking; selective seam

testing (ut), phased array ultrasonic testing (paut), inverse wave field extrapolation (iwex),
radiography, or magnetic particle inspection (mpi);
(5)
guided wave ultrasonic testing (gwut) as described in appendix f. the use of gwut is appropriate
for internal and external pipe wall loss;
(6)
direct assessment to address threats of external corrosion, internal corrosion, and stress corrosion
cracking. the use of direct assessment to address threats of external corrosion, internal corrosion,
and stress corrosion cracking is allowed only if appropriate for the threat and pipeline segment
being assessed. use of direct assessment for threats other than the threat for which the direct
assessment method is suitable is not allowed. an operator must conduct the direct assessment in
accordance with the requirements listed in § 192.923 and with the applicable requirements specified
in §§ 192.925, 192.927, and 192.929;

covered segment and include the results of each indirect assessment as part of the overall
evaluation. this evaluation must also include, at a minimum, the leak repair and inspection records,
corrosion monitoring records, exposed pipe inspection records, and the pipeline environment.
(2)
unprotected pipe or cathodically protected pipe where external corrosion assessments are impractical.
if an external corrosion assessment is impractical on the covered segment an operator must—
(i)
conduct leakage surveys as required by § 192.706 at 4-month intervals; and
(ii)
every 18 months, identify and remediate areas of active corrosion by evaluating leak repair and
inspection records, corrosion monitoring records, exposed pipe inspection records, and the
pipeline environment.
(c)
internal corrosion. to address the threat of internal corrosion on a covered segment, an operator must—
(1)
conduct a gas analysis for corrosive agents at least once each calendar year;
(2)
conduct periodic testing of fluids removed from the segment. at least once each calendar year test
the fluids removed from each storage field that may affect a covered segment; and
(3)
at least every seven (7) years, integrate data from the analysis and testing required by paragraphs
(c)(1)-(c)(2) with applicable internal corrosion leak records, incident reports, safety-related condition
reports, repair records, patrol records, exposed pipe reports, and test records, and define and
implement appropriate remediation actions.
(a)
waiver from reassessment interval in limited situations. in the following limited instances, ops may allow a
waiver from a reassessment interval required by § 192.939 if ops finds a waiver would not be
inconsistent with pipeline safety.
(1)
lack of internal inspection tools. an operator who uses internal inspection as an assessment method
may be able to justify a longer reassessment period for a covered segment if internal inspection
tools are not available to assess the line pipe. to justify this, the operator must demonstrate that it
cannot obtain the internal inspection tools within the required reassessment period and that the
actions the operator is taking in the interim ensure the integrity of the covered segment.
(2)
maintain product supply. an operator may be able to justify a longer reassessment period for a
covered segment if the operator demonstrates that it cannot maintain local product supply if it
conducts the reassessment within the required interval.
(b)
how to apply. if one of the conditions specified in paragraph (a) (1) or (a) (2) of this section applies, an
operator may seek a waiver of the required reassessment interval. an operator must apply for a waiver in
accordance with 49 u.s.c. 60118(c), at least 180 days before the end of the required reassessment
interval, unless local product supply issues make the period impractical. if local product supply issues
make the period impractical, an operator must apply for the waiver as soon as the need for the waiver
becomes known.

damage, other outside force damage, material or weld failure, equipment failure, and incorrect
operation.
(3)
rank risks. the operator must evaluate the risks to its pipeline and estimate the relative importance
of each identified threat.
(4)
identify and implement measures to mitigate risks. the operator must determine and implement
measures designed to reduce the risks from failure of its pipeline.
(5)
measure performance, monitor results, and evaluate effectiveness. the operator must monitor, as a
performance measure, the number of leaks eliminated or repaired on its pipeline and their causes.
(6)
periodic evaluation and improvement. the operator must determine the appropriate period for
conducting im program evaluations based on the complexity of its pipeline and changes in factors
affecting the risk of failure. an operator must re-evaluate its entire program at least every 5 years.
the operator must consider the results of the performance monitoring in these evaluations.
(c)
records. the operator must maintain, for a period of at least 10 years, the following records:

ii.
steel pipe of unknown or unlisted specification.
a.
bending properties. for pipe 2 inches (51 millimeters) or less in diameter, a length of pipe must be
cold bent through at least 90 degrees around a cylindrical mandrel that has a diameter 12 times the
diameter of the pipe, without developing cracks at any portion and without opening the longitudinal
weld.
for pipe more than 2 inches (51 millimeters) in diameter, the pipe must meet the requirements of the
flattening tests set forth in astm a53/a53m (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7), except that
the number of tests must be at least equal to the minimum required in paragraph ii-d of this
appendix to determine yield strength.
b.
weldability. a girth weld must be made in the pipe by a welder who is qualified under subpart e of
this part. the weld must be made under the most severe conditions under which welding will be
allowed in the field and by means of the same procedure that will be used in the field. on pipe more
than 4 inches (102 millimeters) in diameter, at least one test weld must be made for each 100
lengths of pipe. on pipe 4 inches (102 millimeters) or less in diameter, at least one test weld must be
made for each 400 lengths of pipe. the weld must be tested in accordance with api standard 1104
(incorporated by reference, see § 192.7). if the requirements of api standard 1104 cannot be met,
weldability may be established by making chemical tests for carbon and manganese, and
proceeding in accordance with section ix of the asme boiler and pressure vessel code (ibr, see
192.7). the same number of chemical tests must be made as are required for testing a girth weld.
c.
inspection. the pipe must be clean enough to permit adequate inspection. it must be visually
inspected to ensure that it is reasonably round and straight and there are no defects which might
impair the strength or tightness of the pipe.
d.
tensile properties. if the tensile properties of the pipe are not known, the minimum yield strength
may be taken as 24,000 p.s.i. (165 mpa) or less, or the tensile properties may be established by
performing tensile tests as set forth in api specification 5l (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7).
all test specimens shall be selected at random and the following number of tests must be
performed:

iii.
steel pipe manufactured before november 12, 1970, to earlier editions of listed specifications. steel pipe
manufactured before november 12, 1970, in accordance with a specification of which a later edition is
listed in section i of this appendix, is qualified for use under this part if the following requirements are
met:
a.
inspection. the pipe must be clean enough to permit adequate inspection. it must be visually
inspected to ensure that it is reasonably round and straight and that there are no defects which
might impair the strength or tightness of the pipe.
b.
similarity of specification requirements. the edition of the listed specification under which the pipe
was manufactured must have substantially the same requirements with respect to the following
properties as a later edition of that specification listed in section i of this appendix:
(1)
physical (mechanical) properties of pipe, including yield and tensile strength, elongation, and
yield to tensile ratio, and testing requirements to verify those properties.
(2)
chemical properties of pipe and testing requirements to verify those properties.
c.
inspection or test of welded pipe. on pipe with welded seams, one of the following requirements
must be met:
(1)
the edition of the listed specification to which the pipe was manufactured must have
substantially the same requirements with respect to nondestructive inspection of welded
seams and the standards for acceptance or rejection and repair as a later edition of the
specification listed in section i of this appendix.
(2)
the pipe must be tested in accordance with subpart j of this part to at least 1.25 times the
maximum allowable operating pressure if it is to be installed in a class 1 location and to at
least 1.5 times the maximum allowable operating pressure if it is to be installed in a class 2, 3,
or 4 location. notwithstanding any shorter time period permitted under subpart j of this part,
the test pressure must be maintained for at least 8 hours.
i.
basic test. the test is made on pipe 12 inches (305 millimeters) or less in diameter. the test weld must be
made with the pipe in a horizontal fixed position so that the test weld includes at least one section of
overhead position welding. the beveling, root opening, and other details must conform to the
specifications of the procedure under which the welder is being qualified. upon completion, the test weld

appendix d to part 192—criteria for cathodic protection and determination of measurements
is cut into four coupons and subjected to a root bend test. if, as a result of this test, two or more of the
four coupons develop a crack in the weld material, or between the weld material and base metal, that is
more than 1⁄8-inch (3.2 millimeters) long in any direction, the weld is unacceptable. cracks that occur on
the corner of the specimen during testing are not considered. a welder who successfully passes a butt-
weld qualification test under this section shall be qualified to weld on all pipe diameters less than or equal
to 12 inches.
ii.
additional tests for welders of service line connections to mains. a service line connection fitting is welded
to a pipe section with the same diameter as a typical main. the weld is made in the same position as it is
made in the field. the weld is unacceptable if it shows a serious undercutting or if it has rolled edges. the
weld is tested by attempting to break the fitting off the run pipe. the weld is unacceptable if it breaks and
shows incomplete fusion, overlap, or poor penetration at the junction of the fitting and run pipe.
iii.
periodic tests for welders of small service lines. two samples of the welder's work, each about 8 inches
(203 millimeters) long with the weld located approximately in the center, are cut from steel service line
and tested as follows:
(1)
one sample is centered in a guided bend testing machine and bent to the contour of the die for a
distance of 2 inches (51 millimeters) on each side of the weld. if the sample shows any breaks or
cracks after removal from the bending machine, it is unacceptable.
(2)
the ends of the second sample are flattened and the entire joint subjected to a tensile strength test.
if failure occurs adjacent to or in the weld metal, the weld is unacceptable. if a tensile strength
testing machine is not available, this sample must also pass the bending test prescribed in
subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.
i.
criteria for cathodic protection—
a.
steel, cast iron, and ductile iron structures.
(1)
a negative (cathodic) voltage of at least 0.85 volt, with reference to a saturated copper-copper
sulfate half cell. determination of this voltage must be made with the protective current
applied, and in accordance with sections ii and iv of this appendix.
(2)
a negative (cathodic) voltage shift of at least 300 millivolts. determination of this voltage shift
must be made with the protective current applied, and in accordance with sections ii and iv of
this appendix. this criterion of voltage shift applies to structures not in contact with metals of
different anodic potentials.
(3)
a minimum negative (cathodic) polarization voltage shift of 100 millivolts. this polarization
voltage shift must be determined in accordance with sections iii and iv of this appendix.
(4)
a voltage at least as negative (cathodic) as that originally established at the beginning of the
tafel segment of the e-log-i curve. this voltage must be measured in accordance with section
iv of this appendix.
(5)
a net protective current from the electrolyte into the structure surface as measured by an earth
current technique applied at predetermined current discharge (anodic) points of the structure.

b.
aluminum structures.
(1)
except as provided in paragraphs (3) and (4) of this paragraph, a minimum negative (cathodic)
voltage shift of 150 millivolts, produced by the application of protective current. the voltage
shift must be determined in accordance with sections ii and iv of this appendix.
(2)
except as provided in paragraphs (3) and (4) of this paragraph, a minimum negative (cathodic)
polarization voltage shift of 100 millivolts. this polarization voltage shift must be determined in
accordance with sections iii and iv of this appendix.
(3)
notwithstanding the alternative minimum criteria in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph,
aluminum, if cathodically protected at voltages in excess of 1.20 volts as measured with
reference to a copper-copper sulfate half cell, in accordance with section iv of this appendix,
and compensated for the voltage (ir) drops other than those across the structure-electrolyte
boundary may suffer corrosion resulting from the build-up of alkali on the metal surface. a
voltage in excess of 1.20 volts may not be used unless previous test results indicate no
appreciable corrosion will occur in the particular environment.
(4)
since aluminum may suffer from corrosion under high ph conditions, and since application of
cathodic protection tends to increase the ph at the metal surface, careful investigation or
testing must be made before applying cathodic protection to stop pitting attack on aluminum
structures in environments with a natural ph in excess of 8.
c.
copper structures. a minimum negative (cathodic) polarization voltage shift of 100 millivolts. this
polarization voltage shift must be determined in accordance with sections iii and iv of this appendix.
d.
metals of different anodic potentials. a negative (cathodic) voltage, measured in accordance with
section iv of this appendix, equal to that required for the most anodic metal in the system must be
maintained. if amphoteric structures are involved that could be damaged by high alkalinity covered
by paragraphs (3) and (4) of paragraph b of this section, they must be electrically isolated with
insulating flanges, or the equivalent.
ii.
interpretation of voltage measurement. voltage (ir) drops other than those across the structure-electrolyte
boundary must be considered for valid interpretation of the voltage measurement in paragraphs a(1) and
(2) and paragraph b(1) of section i of this appendix.
iii.
determination of polarization voltage shift. the polarization voltage shift must be determined by
interrupting the protective current and measuring the polarization decay. when the current is initially
interrupted, an immediate voltage shift occurs. the voltage reading after the immediate shift must be
used as the base reading from which to measure polarization decay in paragraphs a(3), b(2), and c of
section i of this appendix.
iv.
reference half cells.
a.
except as provided in paragraphs b and c of this section, negative (cathodic) voltage must be
measured between the structure surface and a saturated copper-copper sulfate half cell contacting
the electrolyte.
b.
other standard reference half cells may be substituted for the saturated cooper-copper sulfate half
cell. two commonly used reference half cells are listed below along with their voltage equivalent to
−0.85 volt as referred to a saturated copper-copper sulfate half cell:

its voltage equivalent referred to a saturated copper-copper sulfate half cell is established.
to determine which segments of an operator's transmission pipeline system are covered for purposes of
the integrity management program requirements, an operator must identify the high consequence areas.
an operator must use method (1) or (2) from the definition in § 192.903 to identify a high consequence
area. an operator may apply one method to its entire pipeline system, or an operator may apply one
method to individual portions of the pipeline system. (refer to figure e.i.a for a diagram of a high
consequence area).

[amdt. 192-95, 69 fr 18234, apr. 6, 2004, as amended by amdt. 192-95, may 26, 2004]
appendix f to part 192—criteria for conducting integrity assessments using guided wave
ultrasonic testing (gwut)
this appendix defines criteria which must be properly implemented for use of guided wave ultrasonic testing
(gwut) as an integrity assessment method. any application of gwut that does not conform to these criteria is
considered “other technology” as described by §§ 192.710(c)(7), 192.921(a)(7), and 192.937(c)(7), for which ops
must be notified 90 days prior to use in accordance with §§ 192.921(a)(7) or 192.937(c)(7). gwut in the “go-no
go” mode means that all indications (wall loss anomalies) above the testing threshold (a maximum of 5% of cross
sectional area (csa) sensitivity) be directly examined, in-line tool inspected, pressure tested, or replaced prior to
completing the integrity assessment on the carrier pipe.
i.
equipment and software: generation. the equipment and the computer software used are critical to the
success of the inspection. computer software for the inspection equipment must be reviewed and
updated, as required, on an annual basis, with intervals not to exceed 15 months, to support sensors,
enhance functionality, and resolve any technical or operational issues identified.
ii.
inspection range. the inspection range and sensitivity are set by the signal to noise (s/n) ratio but must
still keep the maximum threshold sensitivity at 5% cross sectional area (csa). a signal that has an
amplitude that is at least twice the noise level can be reliably interpreted. the greater the s/n ratio the
easier it is to identify and interpret signals from small changes. the signal to noise ratio is dependent on
several variables such as surface roughness, coating, coating condition, associated pipe fittings (t's,
elbows, flanges), soil compaction, and environment. each of these affects the propagation of sound
waves and influences the range of the test. it may be necessary to inspect from both ends of the pipeline
segment to achieve a full inspection. in general, the inspection range can approach 60 to 100 feet for a
5% csa, depending on field conditions.
iii.
complete pipe inspection. to ensure that the entire pipeline segment is assessed there should be at least
a 2 to 1 signal to noise ratio across the entire pipeline segment that is inspected. this may require
multiple gwut shots. double-ended inspections are expected. these two inspections are to be overlaid
to show the minimum 2 to 1 s/n ratio is met in the middle. if possible, show the same near or midpoint
feature from both sides and show an approximate 5% distance overlap.
iv.
sensitivity. the detection sensitivity threshold determines the ability to identify a cross sectional change.
the maximum threshold sensitivity cannot be greater than 5% of the cross sectional area (csa).
the locations and estimated csa of all metal loss features in excess of the detection threshold must be
determined and documented.
all defect indications in the “go-no go” mode above the 5% testing threshold must be directly examined,
in-line inspected, pressure tested, or replaced prior to completing the integrity assessment.
v.
wave frequency. because a single wave frequency may not detect certain defects, a minimum of three
frequencies must be run for each inspection to determine the best frequency for characterizing
indications. the frequencies used for the inspections must be documented and must be in the range
specified by the manufacturer of the equipment.
vi.
signal or wave type: torsional and longitudinal. both torsional and longitudinal waves must be used and
use must be documented.

accounts for coating, pipe diameter, pipe wall and environmental conditions at the assessment location.
the dac curve must be set for each inspection as part of establishing the effective range of a gwut
inspection. dac curves provide a means for evaluating the cross-sectional area change of reflections at
various distances in the test range by assessing signal to noise ratio. a dac curve is a means of taking
apparent attenuation into account along the time base of a test signal. it is a line of equal sensitivity along
the trace which allows the amplitudes of signals at different axial distances from the collar to be
compared.
viii. dead zone. the dead zone is the area adjacent to the collar in which the transmitted signal blinds the
received signal, making it impossible to obtain reliable results. because the entire line must be inspected,
inspection procedures must account for the dead zone by requiring the movement of the collar for
additional inspections. an alternate method of obtaining valid readings in the dead zone is to use b-scan
ultrasonic equipment and visual examination of the external surface. the length of the dead zone and the
near field for each inspection must be documented.
ix.
near field effects. the near field is the region beyond the dead zone where the receiving amplifiers are
increasing in power, before the wave is properly established. because the entire line must be inspected,
inspection procedures must account for the near field by requiring the movement of the collar for
additional inspections. an alternate method of obtaining valid readings in the near field is to use b-scan
ultrasonic equipment and visual examination of the external surface. the length of the dead zone and the
near field for each inspection must be documented.
x.
coating type. coatings can have the effect of attenuating the signal. their thickness and condition are the
primary factors that affect the rate of signal attenuation. due to their variability, coatings make it difficult
to predict the effective inspection distance. several coating types may affect the gwut results to the
point that they may reduce the expected inspection distance. for example, concrete coated pipe may be
problematic when well bonded due to the attenuation effects. if an inspection is done and the required
sensitivity is not achieved for the entire length of the pipe, then another type of assessment method must
be utilized.
xi.
end seal. when assessing cased carrier pipe with gwut, operators must remove the end seal from the
casing at each gwut test location to facilitate visual inspection. operators must remove debris and
water from the casing at the end seals. any corrosion material observed must be removed, collected and
reviewed by the operator's corrosion technician. the end seal does not interfere with the accuracy of the
gwut inspection but may have a dampening effect on the range.
xii. weld calibration to set dac curve. accessible welds, along or outside the pipeline segment to be
inspected, must be used to set the dac curve. a weld or welds in the access hole (secondary area) may
be used if welds along the pipeline segment are not accessible. in order to use these welds in the
secondary area, sufficient distance must be allowed to account for the dead zone and near field. there
must not be a weld between the transducer collar and the calibration weld. a conservative estimate of the
predicted amplitude for the weld is 25% csa (cross sectional area) and can be used if welds are not
accessible. calibrations (setting of the dac curve) should be on pipe with similar properties such as wall
thickness and coating. if the actual weld cap height is different from the assumed weld cap height, the
estimated csa may be inaccurate and adjustments to the dac curve may be required. alternative means
of calibration can be used if justified by a documented engineering analysis and evaluation.
xiii. validation of operator training. pipeline operators must require all guided wave service providers to have
equipment-specific training and experience for all gwut equipment operators which includes training for:

a.
equipment operation,
b.
field data collection, and
c.
data interpretation on cased and buried pipe.
only individuals who have been qualified by the manufacturer or an independently assessed
evaluation procedure similar to iso 9712 (sections: 5 responsibilities; 6 levels of qualification; 7
eligibility; and 10 certification), as specified above, may operate the equipment. a senior-level gwut
equipment operator with pipeline specific experience must provide onsite oversight of the inspection
and approve the final reports. a senior-level gwut equipment operator must have additional training
and experience, including training specific to cased and buried pipe, with a quality control program
which that conforms to section 12 of asme b31.8s (for availability, see § 192.7).
xiv. training and experience minimums for senior level gwut equipment operators:
• equipment manufacturer's minimum qualification for equipment operation and data collection with
specific endorsements for casings and buried pipe
• training, qualification and experience in testing procedures and frequency determination
• training, qualification and experience in conversion of guided wave data into pipe features and
estimated metal loss (estimated cross-sectional area loss and circumferential extent)
• equipment manufacturer's minimum qualification with specific endorsements for data interpretation of
anomaly features for pipe within casings and buried pipe.
xv. equipment: traceable from vendor to inspection company. an operator must maintain documentation of
the version of the gwut software used and the serial number of the other equipment such as collars,
cables, etc., in the report.
xvi. calibration onsite. the gwut equipment must be calibrated for performance in accordance with the
manufacturer's requirements and specifications, including the frequency of calibrations. a diagnostic
check and system check must be performed on-site each time the equipment is relocated to a different
casing or pipeline segment. if on-site diagnostics show a discrepancy with the manufacturer's
requirements and specifications, testing must cease until the equipment can be restored to
manufacturer's specifications.
xvii. use on shorted casings (direct or electrolytic). gwut may not be used to assess shorted casings. gwut
operators must have operations and maintenance procedures (see § 192.605) to address the effect of
shorted casings on the gwut signal. the equipment operator must clear any evidence of interference,
other than some slight dampening of the gwut signal from the shorted casing, according to their
operating and maintenance procedures. all shorted casings found while conducting gwut inspections
must be addressed by the operator's standard operating procedures.
xviii. direct examination of all indications above the detection sensitivity threshold. the use of gwut in the “go-
no go” mode requires that all indications (wall loss anomalies) above the testing threshold (5% of csa
sensitivity) be directly examined (or replaced) prior to completing the integrity assessment on the cased
carrier pipe or other gwut application. if this cannot be accomplished, then alternative methods of
assessment (such as hydrostatic pressure tests or ili) must be utilized.
