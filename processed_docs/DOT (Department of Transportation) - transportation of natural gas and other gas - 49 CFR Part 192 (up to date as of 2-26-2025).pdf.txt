(a)
An operator must use API RP 80 (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7), to determine if an onshore
pipeline (or part of a connected series of pipelines) is an onshore gathering line. The determination is
subject to the limitations listed below. After making this determination, an operator must determine if the
onshore gathering line is a regulated onshore gathering line under paragraph (b) of this 

ine if the
onshore gathering line is a regulated onshore gathering line under paragraph (b) of this section.
(1)
The beginning of gathering, under section 2.2(a)(1) of API RP 80, may not extend beyond the
furthermost downstream point in a production operation as defined in section 2.3 of API RP 80. This
furthermost downstream point does not include equipment that can be used in either production or
transportation, such as separators or dehydrators, unless that equipment is involved in the
proces

r
transportation, such as separators or dehydrators, unless that equipment is involved in the
processes of “production and preparation for transportation or delivery of hydrocarbon gas” within
the meaning of “production operation.”
(2)
The endpoint of gathering, under section 2.2(a)(1)(A) of API RP 80, may not extend beyond the first
downstream natural gas processing plant, unless the operator can demonstrate, using sound
engineering principles, that gathering extends to a further downstream pla

 demonstrate, using sound

Unless the actual maximum cover depth is known, the operator shall measure the actual cover in at
least three places where the cover is most likely to be greatest and shall use the greatest cover
measured.
(3)
Unless the actual nominal wall thickness is known, the operator shall determine the wall thickness by
cutting and measuring coupons from at least three separate pipe lengths. The coupons must be cut
from pipe lengths in areas where the cover depth is most likely to be th

hs. The coupons must be cut
from pipe lengths in areas where the cover depth is most likely to be the greatest. The average of all
measurements taken must be increased by the allowance indicated in the following table:

ECA Analysis.
(1)
The material properties required to perform an ECA analysis in accordance with this paragraph are
as follows: Diameter, wall thickness, seam type, grade (minimum yield strength and ultimate tensile
strength), and Charpy v-notch toughness values based upon the lowest operational temperatures, if
applicable. If any material properties required to perform an ECA for any pipeline segment in
accordance with this paragraph are not documented in traceable, verifiable and complete 

 segment in
accordance with this paragraph are not documented in traceable, verifiable and complete records, an
operator must use conservative assumptions and include the pipeline segment in its program to
verify the undocumented information in accordance with § 192.607. The ECA must integrate,
analyze, and account for the material properties, the results of all tests, direct examinations,
destructive tests, and assessments performed in accordance with this section, along with other
pertinent in

tive tests, and assessments performed in accordance with this section, along with other
pertinent information related to pipeline integrity, including close interval surveys, coating surveys,
interference surveys required by subpart I of this part, cause analyses of prior incidents, prior
pressure test leaks and failures, other leaks, pipe inspections, and prior integrity assessments,
including those required by §§ 192.617, 192.710, and subpart O of this part.
(2)
The ECA must analyze and determ

ose required by §§ 192.617, 192.710, and subpart O of this part.
(2)
The ECA must analyze and determine the predicted failure pressure for the defect being assessed
using procedures that implement the appropriate failure criteria and justification as follows:
(i)
The ECA must analyze any cracks or crack-like defects remaining in the pipe, or that could
remain in the pipe, to determine the predicted failure pressure of each defect in accordance
with § 192.712.
(ii)
The ECA must analyze any metal 

d failure pressure of each defect in accordance
with § 192.712.
(ii)
The ECA must analyze any metal loss defects not associated with a dent, including corrosion,
gouges, scrapes or other metal loss defects that could remain in the pipe, to determine the
predicted failure pressure. ASME/ANSI B31G (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7) or R-
STRENG (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7) must be used for corrosion defects. Both
procedures and their analysis apply to corroded regions that do not

used for corrosion defects. Both
procedures and their analysis apply to corroded regions that do not penetrate the pipe wall over
80 percent of the wall thickness and are subject to the limitations prescribed in the equations'
procedures. The ECA must use conservative assumptions for metal loss dimensions (length,
width, and depth).
(iii) When determining the predicted failure pressure for gouges, scrapes, selective seam weld
corrosion, crack-related defects, or any defect within a dent, appropr

 scrapes, selective seam weld
corrosion, crack-related defects, or any defect within a dent, appropriate failure criteria and
justification of the criteria must be used and documented.
(iv) If SMYS or actual material yield and ultimate tensile strength is not known or not documented
by traceable, verifiable, and complete records, then the operator must assume 30,000 p.s.i. or

Direct assessment is an integrity assessment method that utilizes a process to evaluate certain threats (i.e.,
external corrosion, internal corrosion and stress corrosion cracking) to a covered pipeline segment's
integrity. The process includes the gathering and integration of risk factor data, indirect examination or
analysis to identify areas of suspected corrosion, direct examination of the pipeline in these areas, and
post assessment evaluation.
High consequence area means an area establishe

eline in these areas, and
post assessment evaluation.
High consequence area means an area established by one of the methods described in paragraphs (1) or (2) as
follows:
(1)
An area defined as—
(i)
A Class 3 location under § 192.5; or
(ii)
A Class 4 location under § 192.5; or
(iii) Any area in a Class 1 or Class 2 location where the potential impact radius is greater than 660
feet (200 meters), and the area within a potential impact circle contains 20 or more buildings
intended for human occupa

nd the area within a potential impact circle contains 20 or more buildings
intended for human occupancy; or
(iv) Any area in a Class 1 or Class 2 location where the potential impact circle contains an identified
site.
(2)
The area within a potential impact circle containing—
(i)
20 or more buildings intended for human occupancy, unless the exception in paragraph (4)
applies; or
(ii)
An identified site.
(3)
Where a potential impact circle is calculated under either method (1) or (2) to establish 

site.
(3)
Where a potential impact circle is calculated under either method (1) or (2) to establish a high
consequence area, the length of the high consequence area extends axially along the length of the
pipeline from the outermost edge of the first potential impact circle that contains either an identified
site or 20 or more buildings intended for human occupancy to the outermost edge of the last
contiguous potential impact circle that contains either an identified site or 20 or more buildings

t
contiguous potential impact circle that contains either an identified site or 20 or more buildings
intended for human occupancy. (See figure E.I.A. in appendix E.)
(4)
If in identifying a high consequence area under paragraph (1)(iii) of this definition or paragraph (2)(i)
of this definition, the radius of the potential impact circle is greater than 660 feet (200 meters), the
operator may identify a high consequence area based on a prorated number of buildings intended
for human occupancy with

fy a high consequence area based on a prorated number of buildings intended
for human occupancy with a distance of 660 feet (200 meters) from the centerline of the pipeline
until December 17, 2006. If an operator chooses this approach, the operator must prorate the
number of buildings intended for human occupancy based on the ratio of an area with a radius of
660 feet (200 meters) to the area of the potential impact circle (i.e., the prorated number of buildings
intended for human occupancy is e

he potential impact circle (i.e., the prorated number of buildings
intended for human occupancy is equal to 20 × (660 feet) [or 200 meters]/potential impact radius in
feet [or meters]2).
Identified site means each of the following areas:
(a)
An outside area or open structure that is occupied by twenty (20) or more persons on at least 50
days in any twelve (12)-month period. (The days need not be consecutive.) Examples include but are
not limited to, beaches, playgrounds, recreational facilities,

Potential impact circle is a circle of radius equal to the potential impac

sisted-living facilities.
Potential impact circle is a circle of radius equal to the potential impact radius (PIR).
Potential impact radius (PIR) means the radius of a circle within which the potential failure of a pipeline could
have significant impact on people or property. PIR is determined by the formula r = 0.69* (square root of
(p*d2)), where ‘r’ is the radius of a circular area in feet surrounding the point of failure, ‘p’ is the maximum
allowable operating pressure (MAOP) in the pipeline

ounding the point of failure, ‘p’ is the maximum
allowable operating pressure (MAOP) in the pipeline segment in pounds per square inch and ‘d’ is the
nominal diameter of the pipeline in inches.
Remediation is a repair or mitigation activity an operator takes on a covered segment to limit or reduce the
probability of an undesired event occurring or the expected consequences from the event.
(a)
General. To determine which segments of an operator's transmission pipeline system are covered by this
s

ral. To determine which segments of an operator's transmission pipeline system are covered by this
subpart, an operator must identify the high consequence areas. An operator must use method (1) or (2)
from the definition in § 192.903 to identify a high consequence area. An operator may apply one method
to its entire pipeline system, or an operator may apply one method to individual portions of the pipeline
system. An operator must describe in its integrity management program which method it is a

 pipeline
system. An operator must describe in its integrity management program which method it is applying to
each portion of the operator's pipeline system. The description must include the potential impact radius
when utilized to establish a high consequence area. (See appendix E.I. for guidance on identifying high
consequence areas.)
(b)
(1)
Identified sites. An operator must identify an identified site, for purposes of this subpart, from
information the operator has obtained from routine op

ified site, for purposes of this subpart, from
information the operator has obtained from routine operation and maintenance activities and from
public officials with safety or emergency response or planning responsibilities who indicate to the
operator that they know of locations that meet the identified site criteria. These public officials could
include officials on a local emergency planning commission or relevant Native American tribal
officials.

(c)
Newly identified areas. When an operator has information that the area around a pipeline segment not
previously identified as a high consequence area could satisfy any of the definitions in § 192.903, the
operator must complete the evaluation using method (1) or (2). If the segment is determined to meet the
definition as a high consequence area, it must be incorporated 

he segment is determined to meet the
definition as a high consequence area, it must be incorporated into the operator's baseline assessment
plan as a high consequence area within one year from the date the area is identified.
(a)

must assume the presence of threats in the covered segment that could be exacerbated by cyclic
fatigue. An operator must use the results from the analysis together with the crite

rbated by cyclic
fatigue. An operator must use the results from the analysis together with the criteria used to
determine the significance of the threat(s) to the covered segment to prioritize the integrity baseline
assessment or reassessment. Failure stress pressure and crack growth analysis of cracks and

(a)
Definition. Internal Corrosion Direct Assessment (ICDA) is a process an operator uses to identify areas
along the pipeline where fluid or other electrolyte introduced during normal operation or by an upset
condition may reside, and then focuses direct examination on the locations in covered segments where
internal corrosion is 

nd then focuses direct examination on the locations in covered segments where
internal corrosion is most likely to exist. The process identifies the potential for internal corrosion caused
by microorganisms, or fluid with CO2, O2, hydrogen sulfide or other contaminants present in the gas.
(b)
General requirements. An operator using direct assessment as an assessment method to address internal
corrosion in a covered pipeline segment must follow the requirements in this section and in NACE
SP0206 

osion in a covered pipeline segment must follow the requirements in this section and in NACE
SP0206 (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7). The Dry Gas Internal Corrosion Direct Assessment (DG-
ICDA) process described in this section applies only for a segment of pipe transporting normally dry
natural gas (see § 192.3) and not for a segment with electrolytes normally present in the gas stream. If an
operator uses ICDA to assess a covered segment operating with electrolytes present in the gas s

f an
operator uses ICDA to assess a covered segment operating with electrolytes present in the gas stream,
the operator must develop a plan that demonstrates how it will conduct ICDA in the segment to address
internal corrosion effectively and must notify PHMSA in accordance with § 192.18. In the event of a
conflict between this section and NACE SP0206, the requirements in this section control.
(c)

The ICDA plan. An operator must develop and follow an ICDA plan that meets NACE SP0206 (incorporated
by reference, see § 192.7) and that implements all four steps of the DG-ICDA process, including pre-
assessment, indirect inspection, detailed examination at excavation locations, and post-assessment
evaluation and monitoring. The plan must identify the locations of all ICDA regions within covered
segments in the transmission system. An ICDA region is a continuous length of pipe (including weld

d
segments in the transmission system. An ICDA region is a continuous length of pipe (including weld
joints), uninterrupted by any significant change in water or flow characteristics, that includes similar
physical characteristics or operating history. An ICDA region extends from the location where liquid may
first enter the pipeline and encompasses the entire area along the pipeline where internal corrosion may
occur until a new input introduces the possibility of water entering the pipeline. I

assessment method must be selected. When performing the indirect inspection, the operator must
use actual pipeline-specific data, exclusively. The use of assumed pipeline or operational data is
prohibited. When calculating the critical inclination angle of liquid holdup and the inclination profile
of the pipeline, the operator must consider the accuracy, reliability, and uncertainty of the data used
to make those 

he operator must consider the accuracy, reliability, and uncertainty of the data used
to make those calculations, including, but not limited to, gas flow velocity (including during upset
conditions), pipeline elevation profile survey data (including specific profile at features with
inclinations such as road crossings, river crossings, drains, valves, drips, etc.), topographical data,
and depth of cover. An operator must select locations for direct examination and establish the
extent of pipe ex

 cover. An operator must select locations for direct examination and establish the
extent of pipe exposure needed (i.e., the size of the bell hole), to account for these uncertainties and
their cumulative effect on the precise location of predicted liquid dropout.

ICDA for a covered segment, an operator must identify a minimum of two locations for excavation
within each covered segment associated with the ICDA region and must perform a detailed
examination for internal corrosion at each location using ultrasonic thickness measurements,
radiography, or other generally accepted measurement techniques that can examine for internal
corrosion or other threats that are being assessed. One locatio

Appendix F to Part 192—Criteria for Conducting Integrity Assessments Using Guided Wave
Ultrasonic Testing (GWUT)
This appendix defines criteria which must be properly implemented for use of guided wave ultrasonic testing
(GWUT) as an integrity assessment method. Any application of GWUT that does not conform to these criteria is
considered “other technology” as described by §§ 192.710(c)(7), 192.921(a)(7), and 192

e criteria is
considered “other technology” as described by §§ 192.710(c)(7), 192.921(a)(7), and 192.937(c)(7), for which OPS
must be notified 90 days prior to use in accordance with §§ 192.921(a)(7) or 192.937(c)(7). GWUT in the “Go-No
Go” mode means that all indications (wall loss anomalies) above the testing threshold (a maximum of 5% of cross
sectional area (CSA) sensitivity) be directly examined, in-line tool inspected, pressure tested, or replaced prior to
completing the integrity assessme

ned, in-line tool inspected, pressure tested, or replaced prior to
completing the integrity assessment on the carrier pipe.
I.
Equipment and Software: Generation. The equipment and the computer software used are critical to the
success of the inspection. Computer software for the inspection equipment must be reviewed and
updated, as required, on an annual basis, with intervals not to exceed 15 months, to support sensors,
enhance functionality, and resolve any technical or operational issues iden

ths, to support sensors,
enhance functionality, and resolve any technical or operational issues identified.
II.
Inspection Range. The inspection range and sensitivity are set by the signal to noise (S/N) ratio but must
still keep the maximum threshold sensitivity at 5% cross sectional area (CSA). A signal that has an
amplitude that is at least twice the noise level can be reliably interpreted. The greater the S/N ratio the
easier it is to identify and interpret signals from small changes. The si

 greater the S/N ratio the
easier it is to identify and interpret signals from small changes. The signal to noise ratio is dependent on
several variables such as surface roughness, coating, coating condition, associated pipe fittings (T's,
elbows, flanges), soil compaction, and environment. Each of these affects the propagation of sound
waves and influences the range of the test. It may be necessary to inspect from both ends of the pipeline
segment to achieve a full inspection. In general, the i

ry to inspect from both ends of the pipeline
segment to achieve a full inspection. In general, the inspection range can approach 60 to 100 feet for a
5% CSA, depending on field conditions.
III.
Complete Pipe Inspection. To ensure that the entire pipeline segment is assessed there should be at least
a 2 to 1 signal to noise ratio across the entire pipeline segment that is inspected. This may require
multiple GWUT shots. Double-ended inspections are expected. These two inspections are to be overla

e
multiple GWUT shots. Double-ended inspections are expected. These two inspections are to be overlaid
to show the minimum 2 to 1 S/N ratio is met in the middle. If possible, show the same near or midpoint
feature from both sides and show an approximate 5% distance overlap.
IV.
Sensitivity. The detection sensitivity threshold determines the ability to identify a cross sectional change.
The maximum threshold sensitivity cannot be greater than 5% of the cross sectional area (CSA).
The locations an

 threshold sensitivity cannot be greater than 5% of the cross sectional area (CSA).
The locations and estimated CSA of all metal loss features in excess of the detection threshold must be
determined and documented.
All defect indications in the “Go-No Go” mode above the 5% testing threshold must be directly examined,
in-line inspected, pressure tested, or replaced prior to completing the integrity assessment.
V.
Wave Frequency. Because a single wave frequency may not detect certain defects, a mi

 assessment.
V.
Wave Frequency. Because a single wave frequency may not detect certain defects, a minimum of three
frequencies must be run for each inspection to determine the best frequency for characterizing
indications. The frequencies used for the inspections must be documented and must be in the range
specified by the manufacturer of the equipment.
VI.
Signal or Wave Type: Torsional and Longitudinal. Both torsional and longitudinal waves must be used and
use must be documented.
49 CFR Part 

tudinal. Both torsional and longitudinal waves must be used and
use must be documented.

VII. Distance Amplitude Correction (DAC) Curve and Weld Calibration. The distance amplitude correction curve
accounts for coating, pipe diameter, pipe wall and environmental conditions at the assessment location.
The DAC curve must be set for each inspection as part of establishing the effective range of a GWUT
inspection. DAC curves provide a means for evaluating the cross-sectional area change of reflections at
various distances in the test range by assessing signal to noise ratio. A DAC curve

f reflections at
various distances in the test range by assessing signal to noise ratio. A DAC curve is a means of taking
apparent attenuation into account along the time base of a test signal. It is a line of equal sensitivity along
the trace which allows the amplitudes of signals at different axial distances from the collar to be
compared.
VIII. Dead Zone. The dead zone is the area adjacent to the collar in which the transmitted signal blinds the
received signal, making it impossible to obtain

he collar in which the transmitted signal blinds the
received signal, making it impossible to obtain reliable results. Because the entire line must be inspected,
inspection procedures must account for the dead zone by requiring the movement of the collar for
additional inspections. An alternate method of obtaining valid readings in the dead zone is to use B-scan
ultrasonic equipment and visual examination of the external surface. The length of the dead zone and the
near field for each inspection

mination of the external surface. The length of the dead zone and the
near field for each inspection must be documented.
IX.
Near Field Effects. The near field is the region beyond the dead zone where the receiving amplifiers are
increasing in power, before the wave is properly established. Because the entire line must be inspected,
inspection procedures must account for the near field by requiring the movement of the collar for
additional inspections. An alternate method of obtaining valid read

g the movement of the collar for
additional inspections. An alternate method of obtaining valid readings in the near field is to use B-scan
ultrasonic equipment and visual examination of the external surface. The length of the dead zone and the
near field for each inspection must be documented.
X.
Coating Type. Coatings can have the effect of attenuating the signal. Their thickness and condition are the
primary factors that affect the rate of signal attenuation. Due to their variability, coating

re the
primary factors that affect the rate of signal attenuation. Due to their variability, coatings make it difficult
to predict the effective inspection distance. Several coating types may affect the GWUT results to the
point that they may reduce the expected inspection distance. For example, concrete coated pipe may be
problematic when well bonded due to the attenuation effects. If an inspection is done and the required
sensitivity is not achieved for the entire length of the pipe, then anot

on is done and the required
sensitivity is not achieved for the entire length of the pipe, then another type of assessment method must
be utilized.
XI.
End Seal. When assessing cased carrier pipe with GWUT, operators must remove the end seal from the
casing at each GWUT test location to facilitate visual inspection. Operators must remove debris and
water from the casing at the end seals. Any corrosion material observed must be removed, collected and
reviewed by the operator's corrosion technicia

sion material observed must be removed, collected and
reviewed by the operator's corrosion technician. The end seal does not interfere with the accuracy of the
GWUT inspection but may have a dampening effect on the range.
XII. Weld Calibration to set DAC Curve. Accessible welds, along or outside the pipeline segment to be
inspected, must be used to set the DAC curve. A weld or welds in the access hole (secondary area) may
be used if welds along the pipeline segment are not accessible. In order t

hole (secondary area) may
be used if welds along the pipeline segment are not accessible. In order to use these welds in the
secondary area, sufficient distance must be allowed to account for the dead zone and near field. There
must not be a weld between the transducer collar and the calibration weld. A conservative estimate of the
predicted amplitude for the weld is 25% CSA (cross sectional area) and can be used if welds are not
accessible. Calibrations (setting of the DAC curve) should be on p

 and can be used if welds are not
accessible. Calibrations (setting of the DAC curve) should be on pipe with similar properties such as wall
thickness and coating. If the actual weld cap height is different from the assumed weld cap height, the
estimated CSA may be inaccurate and adjustments to the DAC curve may be required. Alternative means
of calibration can be used if justified by a documented engineering analysis and evaluation.
XIII. Validation of Operator Training. Pipeline operators must

 engineering analysis and evaluation.
XIII. Validation of Operator Training. Pipeline operators must require all guided wave service providers to have
equipment-specific training and experience for all GWUT Equipment Operators which includes training for:

A.
Equipment operation,
B.
field data collection, and
C.
data interpretation on cased and buried pipe.
Only individuals who have been qualified by the manufacturer or an independently assessed
evaluation procedure similar to ISO 9712 (Sections: 5 Responsibilities; 6 Levels of Qualification; 7
Eligibility; and 10 Certification), as specified above, may operate the equipment. A senior-level GWUT
equipment operator with pipeline specific experience must provide onsite oversight of the inspection
an

ipment operator with pipeline specific experience must provide onsite oversight of the inspection
and approve the final reports. A senior-level GWUT equipment operator must have additional training
and experience, including training specific to cased and buried pipe, with a quality control program
which that conforms to Section 12 of ASME B31.8S (for availability, see § 192.7).
XIV. Training and Experience Minimums for Senior Level GWUT Equipment Operators:
• Equipment Manufacturer's minimum qua

xperience Minimums for Senior Level GWUT Equipment Operators:
• Equipment Manufacturer's minimum qualification for equipment operation and data collection with
specific endorsements for casings and buried pipe
• Training, qualification and experience in testing procedures and frequency determination
• Training, qualification and experience in conversion of guided wave data into pipe features and
estimated metal loss (estimated cross-sectional area loss and circumferential extent)
• Equipment Man

stimated metal loss (estimated cross-sectional area loss and circumferential extent)
• Equipment Manufacturer's minimum qualification with specific endorsements for data interpretation of
anomaly features for pipe within casings and buried pipe.
XV. Equipment: Traceable from vendor to inspection company. An operator must maintain documentation of
the version of the GWUT software used and the serial number of the other equipment such as collars,
cables, etc., in the report.
XVI. Calibration Onsit

l number of the other equipment such as collars,
cables, etc., in the report.
XVI. Calibration Onsite. The GWUT equipment must be calibrated for performance in accordance with the
manufacturer's requirements and specifications, including the frequency of calibrations. A diagnostic
check and system check must be performed on-site each time the equipment is relocated to a different
casing or pipeline segment. If on-site diagnostics show a discrepancy with the manufacturer's
requirements and specif

e segment. If on-site diagnostics show a discrepancy with the manufacturer's
requirements and specifications, testing must cease until the equipment can be restored to
manufacturer's specifications.
XVII. Use on Shorted Casings (direct or electrolytic). GWUT may not be used to assess shorted casings. GWUT
operators must have operations and maintenance procedures (see § 192.605) to address the effect of
shorted casings on the GWUT signal. The equipment operator must clear any evidence of interfer

ct of
shorted casings on the GWUT signal. The equipment operator must clear any evidence of interference,
other than some slight dampening of the GWUT signal from the shorted casing, according to their
operating and maintenance procedures. All shorted casings found while conducting GWUT inspections
must be addressed by the operator's standard operating procedures.
XVIII. Direct examination of all indications above the detection sensitivity threshold. The use of GWUT in the “Go-
No Go” mode requi

indications above the detection sensitivity threshold. The use of GWUT in the “Go-
No Go” mode requires that all indications (wall loss anomalies) above the testing threshold (5% of CSA
sensitivity) be directly examined (or replaced) prior to completing the integrity assessment on the cased
carrier pipe or other GWUT application. If this cannot be accomplished, then alternative methods of
assessment (such as hydrostatic pressure tests or ILI) must be utilized.
