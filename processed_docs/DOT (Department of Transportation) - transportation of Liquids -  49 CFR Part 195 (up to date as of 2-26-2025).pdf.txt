transportation of hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide through onshore production (including flow
lines), refining, or manufacturing facilities or storage or in-plant piping systems associated with such
facilities;
(9)
transportation of hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide:
(i)
by vessel, aircraft, tank truck, tank car, or other non-pipeline mode of transportation; or
(ii)
through facilities located on the grounds of a materials transportation terminal if the facilities
are used exclusively to transfer hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide between non-pipeline modes
of transportation or between a non-pipeline mode and a pipeline. these facilities do not include
any device and associated piping that are necessary to control pressure in the pipeline under §
195.406(b); or

carbon dioxide to an injection well or to a header or manifold from which a pipeline branches to
an injection well.
(c)
breakout tanks. breakout tanks that are subject to this part must comply with requirements that apply
specifically to breakout tanks and, to the extent applicable, with requirements that apply to pipeline
systems and pipeline facilities. if a conflict exists between a requirement that applies specifically to
breakout tanks and a requirement that applies to pipeline systems or pipeline facilities, the requirement
that applies specifically to breakout tanks prevails. anhydrous ammonia breakout tanks need not comply
with §§ 195.132(b); 195.205(b); 195.264(b) and (e); 195.307; 195.428(c) through (d); and 195.432(b) and

(a)
a steel pipeline previously used in service not subject to this part qualifies for use under this part if the
operator prepares and follows a written procedure to accomplish the following:
(1)
the design, construction, operation, and maintenance history of the pipeline must be reviewed and,
where sufficient historical records are not available, appropriate tests must be performed to
determine if the pipeline is in satisfactory condition for safe operation. if one or more of the
variables necessary to verify the design pressure under § 195.106 or to perform the testing under
paragraph (a)(4) of this section is unknown, the design pressure may be verified and the maximum
operating pressure determined by—
(i)
testing the pipeline in accordance with asme b31.8 (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3),
appendix n, to produce a stress equal to the yield strength; and
(ii)
applying, to not more than 80 percent of the first pressure that produces a yielding, the design
factor f in § 195.106(a) and the appropriate factors in § 195.106(e).
(2)
the pipeline right-of-way, all aboveground segments of the pipeline, and appropriately selected
underground segments must be visually inspected for physical defects and operating conditions
which reasonably could be expected to impair the strength or tightness of the pipeline.
(3)
all known unsafe defects and conditions must be corrected in accordance with this part.
(4)
the pipeline must be tested in accordance with subpart e of this part to substantiate the maximum
operating pressure permitted by § 195.406.
(b)
a pipeline that qualifies for use under this section need not comply with the corrosion control
requirements of subpart h of this part until 12 months after it is placed into service, notwithstanding any
previous deadlines for compliance.
(c)
each operator must keep for the life of the pipeline a record of the investigations, tests, repairs,
replacements, and alterations made under the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.
(d)
an operator converting a pipeline from service not previously covered by this part must notify phmsa 60
days before the conversion occurs as required by § 195.64.

§ 195.6 unusually sensitive areas (usas).
as used in this part, a usa means a drinking water or ecological resource area that is unusually sensitive to
environmental damage from a hazardous liquid pipeline release.
(a)
an usa drinking water resource is:
(1)
the water intake for a community water system (cws) or a non-transient non-community water
system (ntncws) that obtains its water supply primarily from a surface water source and does not
have an adequate alternative drinking water source;
(2)
the source water protection area (swpa) for a cws or a ntncws that obtains its water supply
from a class i or class iia aquifer and does not have an adequate alternative drinking water source.
where a state has not yet identified the swpa, the wellhead protection area (whpa) will be used
until the state has identified the swpa; or
(3)
the sole source aquifer recharge area where the sole source aquifer is a karst aquifer in nature.
(b)
an usa ecological resource is:
(1)
an area containing a critically imperiled species or ecological community;
(2)
a multi-species assemblage area;
(3)
a migratory waterbird concentration area;
(4)
an area containing an imperiled species, threatened or endangered species, depleted marine
mammal species, or an imperiled ecological community where the species or community is aquatic,
aquatic dependent, or terrestrial with a limited range;
(5)
an area containing an imperiled species, threatened or endangered species, depleted marine
mammal species, or imperiled ecological community where the species or community occurrence is
considered to be one of the most viable, highest quality, or in the best condition, as identified by an
element occurrence ranking (eorank) of a (excellent quality) or b (good quality) or
(6)
a coastal beach; or
(7)
certain coastal waters.
(c)
definitions used in this part—
adequate alternative drinking water source means a source of water that currently exists, can be used
almost immediately with a minimal amount of effort and cost, involves no decline in water quality,
and will meet the consumptive, hygiene, and fire fighting requirements of the existing population of
impacted customers for at least one month for a surface water source of water and at least six
months for a groundwater source.

aquatic or aquatic dependent species or community means a species or community that primarily occurs
in aquatic, marine, or wetland habitats, as well as species that may use terrestrial habitats during all
or some portion of their life cycle, but that are still closely associated with or dependent upon
aquatic, marine, or wetland habitats for some critical component or portion of their life-history (i.e.,
reproduction, rearing and development, feeding, etc).
class i aquifer means an aquifer that is surficial or shallow, permeable, and is highly vulnerable to
contamination. class i aquifers include:
(1)
unconsolidated aquifers (class ia) that consist of surficial, unconsolidated, and permeable
alluvial, terrace, outwash, beach, dune and other similar deposits. these aquifers generally
contain layers of sand and gravel that, commonly, are interbedded to some degree with silt and
clay. not all class ia aquifers are important water-bearing units, but they are likely to be both
permeable and vulnerable. the only natural protection of these aquifers is the thickness of the
unsaturated zone and the presence of fine-grained material;
(2)
soluble and fractured bedrock aquifers (class ib). lithologies in this class include limestone,
dolomite, and, locally, evaporitic units that contain documented karst features or solution
channels, regardless of size. generally these aquifers have a wide range of permeability. also
included in this class are sedimentary strata, and metamorphic and igneous (intrusive and
extrusive) rocks that are significantly faulted, fractured, or jointed. in all cases groundwater
movement is largely controlled by secondary openings. well yields range widely, but the
important feature is the potential for rapid vertical and lateral ground water movement along
preferred pathways, which result in a high degree of vulnerability;
(3)
semiconsolidated aquifers (class ic) that generally contain poorly to moderately indurated
sand and gravel that is interbedded with clay and silt. this group is intermediate to the
unconsolidated and consolidated end members. these systems are common in the tertiary
age rocks that are exposed throughout the gulf and atlantic coastal states. semiconsolidated
conditions also arise from the presence of intercalated clay and caliche within primarily
unconsolidated to poorly consolidated units, such as occurs in parts of the high plains aquifer;
or
(4)
covered aquifers (class id) that are any class i aquifer overlain by less than 50 feet of low
permeability, unconsolidated material, such as glacial till, lacustrian, and loess deposits.
certain coastal waters means the territorial sea of the united states; the great lakes and their connecting
waters; and the marine and estuarine waters of the united states up to the head of tidal influence.
class iia aquifer means a higher yield bedrock aquifer that is consolidated and is moderately vulnerable to
contamination. these aquifers generally consist of fairly permeable sandstone or conglomerate that
contain lesser amounts of interbedded fine grained clastics (shale, siltstone, mudstone) and
occasionally carbonate units. in general, well yields must exceed 50 gallons per minute to be
included in this class. local fracturing may contribute to the dominant primary porosity and
permeability of these systems.
coastal beach means any land between the high- and low-water marks of certain coastal waters.
community water system (cws) means a public water system that serves at least 15 service connections
used by year-round residents of the area or regularly serves at least 25 year-round residents.

critically imperiled species or ecological community (habitat) means an animal or plant species or an
ecological community of extreme rarity, based on the nature conservancy's global conservation
status rank. there are generally 5 or fewer occurrences, or very few remaining individuals (less than
1,000) or acres (less than 2,000). these species and ecological communities are extremely
vulnerable to extinction due to some natural or man-made factor.
depleted marine mammal species means a species that has been identified and is protected under the
marine mammal protection act of 1972, as amended (mmpa) (16 u.s.c. 1361 et seq.). the term
“depleted” refers to marine mammal species that are listed as threatened or endangered, or are
below their optimum sustainable populations (16 u.s.c. 1362). the term “marine mammal” means
“any mammal which is morphologically adapted to the marine environment (including sea otters and
members of the orders sirenia, pinnipedia, and cetacea), or primarily inhabits the marine
environment (such as the polar bear)” (16 u.s.c. 1362). the order sirenia includes manatees, the
order pinnipedia includes seals, sea lions, and walruses, and the order cetacea includes dolphins,
porpoises, and whales.
ecological community means an interacting assemblage of plants and animals that recur under similar
environmental conditions across the landscape.
element occurrence rank (eorank) means the condition or viability of a species or ecological community
occurrence, based on a population's size, condition, and landscape context. eoranks are assigned
by the natural heritage programs. an eorank of a means an excellent quality and an eorank of b
means good quality.
imperiled species or ecological community (habitat) means a rare species or ecological community, based
on the nature conservancy's global conservation status rank. there are generally 6 to 20
occurrences, or few remaining individuals (1,000 to 3,000) or acres (2,000 to 10,000). these species
and ecological communities are vulnerable to extinction due to some natural or man-made factor.
karst aquifer means an aquifer that is composed of limestone or dolomite where the porosity is derived
from connected solution cavities. karst aquifers are often cavernous with high rates of flow.
migratory waterbird concentration area means a designated ramsar site or a western hemisphere
shorebird reserve network site.
multi-species assemblage area means an area where three or more different critically imperiled or imperiled
species or ecological communities, threatened or endangered species, depleted marine mammals,
or migratory waterbird concentrations co-occur.
non-transient non-community water system (ntncws) means a public water system that regularly serves
at least 25 of the same persons over six months per year. examples of these systems include
schools, factories, and hospitals that have their own water supplies.
public water system (pws) means a system that provides the public water for human consumption
through pipes or other constructed conveyances, if such system has at least 15 service connections
or regularly serves an average of at least 25 individuals daily at least 60 days out of the year. these

§ 195.8 transportation of hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide in pipelines constructed with
other than steel pipe.
no person may transport any hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide through a pipe that is constructed after october 1,
1970, for hazardous liquids or after july 12, 1991 for carbon dioxide of material other than steel unless the person
has notified the administrator in writing at least 90 days before the transportation is to begin. the notice must state
whether carbon dioxide or a hazardous liquid is to be transported and the chemical name, common name,
properties and characteristics of the hazardous liquid to be transported and the material used in construction of the
pipeline. if the administrator determines that the transportation of the hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide in the
manner proposed would be unduly hazardous, he will, within 90 days after receipt of the notice, order the person
that gave the notice, in writing, not to transport the hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide in the proposed manner until
further notice.

subpart c—design requirements
§ 195.100 scope.
this subpart prescribes minimum design requirements for new pipeline systems constructed with steel pipe and for
relocating, replacing, or otherwise changing existing systems constructed with steel pipe. however, it does not
apply to the movement of line pipe covered by § 195.424.
§ 195.101 qualifying metallic components other than pipe.
notwithstanding any requirement of the subpart which incorporates by reference an edition of a document listed in
§ 195.3, a metallic component other than pipe manufactured in accordance with any other edition of that document
is qualified for use if—

§ 195.102 design temperature.
[amdt. 195-45, 56 fr 26925, june 12, 1991]
§ 195.104 variations in pressure.
if, within a pipeline system, two or more components are to be connected at a place where one will operate at a
higher pressure than another, the system must be designed so that any component operating at the lower pressure
will not be overstressed.
§ 195.106 internal design pressure.
(a)
it can be shown through visual inspection of the cleaned component that no defect exists which might
impair the strength or tightness of the component: and
(b)
the edition of the document under which the component was manufactured has equal or more stringent
requirements for the following as an edition of that document currently or previously listed in § 195.3:
(1)
pressure testing;
(2)
materials; and
(3)
pressure and temperature ratings.
(a)
material for components of the system must be chosen for the temperature environment in which the
components will be used so that the pipeline will maintain its structural integrity.
(b)
components of carbon dioxide pipelines that are subject to low temperatures during normal operation
because of rapid pressure reduction or during the initial fill of the line must be made of materials that are
suitable for those low temperatures.
(a)
internal design pressure for the pipe in a pipeline is determined in accordance with the following formula:
p = (2st/d) × e × f

transportation of hazardous liquids by pipeline
49 cfr 195.100
49 cfr 195.106(a) (enhanced display)
page 34 of 123

p = internal design pressure in p.s.i. (kpa) gage.
s = yield strength in pounds per square inch (kpa) determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
t = nominal wall thickness of the pipe in inches (millimeters). if this is unknown, it is determined in accordance
with paragraph (c) of this section.
d = nominal outside diameter of the pipe in inches (millimeters).
e = seam joint factor determined in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.
f = a design factor of 0.72, except that a design factor of 0.60 is used for pipe, including risers, on a platform
located offshore or on a platform in inland navigable waters, and 0.54 is used for pipe that has been subjected
to cold expansion to meet the specified minimum yield strength and is subsequently heated, other than by
welding or stress relieving as a part of welding, to a temperature higher than 900 °f (482 °c) for any period of
time or over 600 °f (316 °c) for more than 1 hour.

(b)
the yield strength to be used in determining the internal design pressure under paragraph (a) of this
section is the specified minimum yield strength. if the specified minimum yield strength is not known, the
yield strength to be used in the design formula is one of the following:
(1)
(i)
the yield strength determined by performing all of the tensile tests of api spec 5l
(incorporated by reference, see § 195.3) on randomly selected specimens with the following
number of tests:
(ii)
if the average yield-tensile ratio exceeds 0.85, the yield strength shall be taken as 24,000 p.s.i.
(165,474 kpa). if the average yield-tensile ratio is 0.85 or less, the yield strength of the pipe is
taken as the lower of the following:
(a)
eighty percent of the average yield strength determined by the tensile tests.
(b)
the lowest yield strength determined by the tensile tests.
(2)
if the pipe is not tensile tested as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the yield strength shall be
taken as 24,000 p.s.i. (165,474 kpa).

(c)
if the nominal wall thickness to be used in determining internal design pressure under paragraph (a) of
this section is not known, it is determined by measuring the thickness of each piece of pipe at quarter
points on one end. however, if the pipe is of uniform grade, size, and thickness, only 10 individual lengths
or 5 percent of all lengths, whichever is greater, need be measured. the thickness of the lengths that are
not measured must be verified by applying a gage set to the minimum thickness found by the
measurement. the nominal wall thickness to be used is the next wall thickness found in commercial
specifications that is below the average of all the measurements taken. however, the nominal wall

[amdt. 195-29, 48 fr 48674, oct. 20, 1983]
§ 195.234 welds: nondestructive testing.
(a)
each weld that is unacceptable under § 195.228 must be removed or repaired. except for welds on an
offshore pipeline being installed from a pipelay vessel, a weld must be removed if it has a crack that is
more than 8 percent of the weld length.
(b)
each weld that is repaired must have the defect removed down to sound metal and the segment to be
repaired must be preheated if conditions exist which would adversely affect the quality of the weld repair.
after repair, the segment of the weld that was repaired must be inspected to ensure its acceptability.
(c)
repair of a crack, or of any defect in a previously repaired area must be in accordance with written weld
repair procedures that have been qualified under § 195.214. repair procedures must provide that the
minimum mechanical properties specified for the welding procedure used to make the original weld are
met upon completion of the final weld repair.
(a)
a weld may be nondestructively tested by any process that will clearly indicate any defects that may
affect the integrity of the weld.
(b)
any nondestructive testing of welds must be performed—
(1)
in accordance with a written set of procedures for nondestructive testing; and
(2)
with personnel that have been trained in the established procedures and in the use of the equipment
employed in the testing.
(c)
procedures for the proper interpretation of each weld inspection must be established to ensure the
acceptability of the weld under § 195.228.
(d)
during construction, at least 10 percent of the girth welds made by each welder and welding operator
during each welding day must be nondestructively tested over the entire circumference of the weld.
(e)
all girth welds installed each day in the following locations must be nondestructively tested over their
entire circumference, except that when nondestructive testing is impracticable for a girth weld, it need not
be tested if the number of girth welds for which testing is impracticable does not exceed 10 percent of
the girth welds installed that day:
(1)
at any onshore location where a loss of hazardous liquid could reasonably be expected to pollute
any stream, river, lake, reservoir, or other body of water, and any offshore area;
(2)
within railroad or public road rights-of-way;
(3)
at overhead road crossings and within tunnels;
(4)
within the limits of any incorporated subdivision of a state government; and
(5)
within populated areas, including, but not limited to, residential subdivisions, shopping centers,
schools, designated commercial areas, industrial facilities, public institutions, and places of public
assembly.
(f)
when installing used pipe, 100 percent of the old girth welds must be nondestructively tested.

(c)
the program under paragraph (a) of this section shall provide for pressure testing for a segment
constructed of electric resistance-welded (erw) pipe and lapwelded pipe manufactured prior to 1970
susceptible to longitudinal seam failures as determined through paragraph (d) of this section. the timing
of such pressure test may be determined based on risk classifications discussed under paragraph (b) of
this section. for other segments, the program may provide for use of a magnetic flux leakage or
ultrasonic internal inspection survey as an alternative to pressure testing and, in the case of such
segments in risk classification a, may provide for no additional measures under this subpart.
(d)
all pre-1970 erw pipe and lapwelded pipe is deemed susceptible to longitudinal seam failures unless an
engineering analysis shows otherwise. in conducting an engineering analysis an operator must consider
the seam-related leak history of the pipe and pipe manufacturing information as available, which may
include the pipe steel's mechanical properties, including fracture toughness; the manufacturing process
and controls related to seam properties, including whether the erw process was high-frequency or low-
frequency, whether the weld seam was heat treated, whether the seam was inspected, the test pressure
and duration during mill hydrotest; the quality control of the steel-making process; and other factors
pertinent to seam properties and quality.
(e)
pressure testing done under this section must be conducted in accordance with this subpart. except for

§ 195.416 pipeline assessments.
(b)
inspection method. an operator must consider the nature of the event and the physical characteristics,
operating conditions, location, and prior history of the affected pipeline in determining the appropriate
method for performing the initial inspection to determine the extent of any damage and the need for the
additional assessments required under paragraph (a) of this section.
(c)
time period. the inspection required under paragraph (a) of this section must commence within 72 hours
after the cessation of the event, defined as the point in time when the affected area can be safely
accessed by the personnel and equipment required to perform the inspection as determined under
paragraph (b) of this section. in the event that the operator is unable to commence the inspection due to
the unavailability of personnel or equipment, the operator must notify the appropriate phmsa region
director as soon as practicable.
(d)
remedial action. an operator must take prompt and appropriate remedial action to ensure the safe
operation of a pipeline based on the information obtained as a result of performing the inspection
required under paragraph (a) of this section. such actions might include, but are not limited to:
(1)
reducing the operating pressure or shutting down the pipeline;
(2)
modifying, repairing, or replacing any damaged pipeline facilities;
(3)
preventing, mitigating, or eliminating any unsafe conditions in the pipeline right-of-way;
(4)
performing additional patrols, surveys, tests, or inspections;
(5)
implementing emergency response activities with federal, state, or local personnel; and
(6)
notifying affected communities of the steps that can be taken to ensure public safety.
(a)
scope. this section applies to onshore line pipe that can accommodate inspection by means of in-line
inspection tools and is not subject to the integrity management requirements in § 195.452.
(b)
general. an operator must perform an initial assessment of each of its pipeline segments by october 1,
2029, and perform periodic assessments of its pipeline segments at least once every 10 calendar years
from the year of the prior assessment or as otherwise necessary to ensure public safety or the protection
of the environment.
(c)
method. except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section, an operator must perform the integrity
assessment for the range of relevant threats to the pipeline segment by the use of an appropriate in-line
inspection tool(s). when performing an assessment using an in-line inspection tool, an operator must
comply with § 195.591. an operator must explicitly consider uncertainties in reported results (including
tool tolerance, anomaly findings, and unity chart plots or other equivalent methods for determining
uncertainties) in identifying anomalies. if this is impracticable based on operational limits, including
operating pressure, low flow, and pipeline length or availability of in-line inspection tool technology for the
pipe diameter, then the operator must perform the assessment using the appropriate method(s) in
paragraphs (c)(1), (2), or (3) of this section for the range of relevant threats being assessed. the methods
an operator selects to assess low-frequency electric resistance welded pipe, pipe with a seam factor less

than 1.0 as defined in § 195.106(e) or lap-welded pipe susceptible to longitudinal seam failure must be
capable of assessing seam integrity, cracking, and of detecting corrosion and deformation anomalies.
the following alternative assessment methods may be used as specified in this paragraph:
(1)
a pressure test conducted in accordance with subpart e of this part;
(2)
external corrosion direct assessment in accordance with § 195.588; or
(3)
other technology in accordance with paragraph (d).
(d)
other technology. operators may elect to use other technologies if the operator can demonstrate the
technology can provide an equivalent understanding of the condition of the line pipe for threat being
assessed. an operator choosing this option must notify the office of pipeline safety (ops) 90 days before
conducting the assessment by:
(1)
sending the notification, along with the information required to demonstrate compliance with this
paragraph, to the information resources manager, office of pipeline safety, pipeline and hazardous
materials safety administration, 1200 new jersey avenue se, washington, dc 20590; or
(2)
sending the notification, along with the information required to demonstrate compliance with this
paragraph, to the information resources manager by facsimile to (202) 366-7128.
(3)
prior to conducting the “other technology” assessments, the operator must receive a notice of “no
objection” from the phmsa information services manager or designee.
(e)
data analysis. a person qualified by knowledge, training, and experience must analyze the data obtained
from an assessment performed under paragraph (b) of this section to determine if a condition could
adversely affect the safe operation of the pipeline. operators must consider uncertainties in any reported
results (including tool tolerance) as part of that analysis.
(f)
discovery of condition. for purposes of § 195.401(b)(1), discovery of a condition occurs when an operator
has adequate information to determine that a condition presenting a potential threat to the integrity of the
pipeline exists. an operator must promptly, but no later than 180 days after an assessment, obtain
sufficient information about a condition to make that determination required under paragraph (e) of this
section, unless the operator can demonstrate the 180-day interval is impracticable. if the operator
believes that 180 days are impracticable to make a determination about a condition found during an
assessment, the pipeline operator must notify phmsa and provide an expected date when adequate
information will become available. this notification must be made in accordance with § 195.452 (m).
(g)
remediation. an operator must comply with the requirements in § 195.401 if a condition that could
adversely affect the safe operation of a pipeline is discovered in complying with paragraphs (e) and (f) of
this section.
(h)
consideration of information. an operator must consider all relevant information about a pipeline in
complying with the requirements in paragraphs (a) through (g) of this section.

§ 195.418 valves: onshore valve shut-off for rupture mitigation.
(a)
as used in this part, a notification of potential rupture means the notification to, or observation by, an
operator (e.g., by or to its controller(s) in a control room, field personnel, nearby pipeline or utility
personnel, the public, local responders, or public authorities) of one or more of the below indicia of a
potential unintentional or uncontrolled release of a large volume of hazardous liquids or carbon dioxide
from a pipeline:
(1)
an unanticipated or unexplained pressure loss outside of the pipeline's normal operating pressures,
as defined in the operator's written procedures. the operator must establish in its written procedures
that an unanticipated or unplanned pressure loss is outside of the pipeline's normal operating
pressures when there is a pressure loss greater than 10 percent occurring within a time interval of
15 minutes or less, unless the operator has documented in its written procedures the operational
need for a greater pressure-change threshold due to pipeline flow dynamics (including changes in
operating pressure, flow rate, or volume), that are caused by fluctuations in product demand,
receipts, or deliveries;
(2)
an unanticipated or unexplained flow rate change, pressure change, equipment function, or other
pipeline instrumentation indication at the upstream or downstream station that may be
representative of an event meeting paragraph (a)(1) of this section; or
(3)
any unanticipated or unexplained rapid release of a large volume of hazardous liquid or carbon
dioxide, a fire, or an explosion, in the immediate vicinity of the pipeline.
(b)
a notification of potential rupture occurs when an operator first receives notice of or observes an event
specified in paragraph (a) of this section.
(c)
the requirements of this section do not apply to gathering lines.
(a)
applicability. for newly constructed and entirely replaced onshore hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide
pipeline segments, as defined at § 195.2, with diameters of 6 inches or greater that could affect high-
consequence areas or are located in high consequence areas (hca), and that have been installed after
april 10, 2023, an operator must install or use existing rupture-mitigation valves (rmv), as defined at §
195.2, or alternative equivalent technologies according to the requirements of this section and § 195.419.
rmvs and alternative equivalent technologies must be operational within 14 days of placing the new or
replaced pipeline segment in service. an operator may request an extension of this 14-day operation
requirement if it can demonstrate to phmsa, in accordance with the notification procedures in § 195.18,
that application of that requirement would be economically, technically, or operationally infeasible. the
requirements of this section apply to all applicable pipe replacements, even those that do not otherwise
directly involve the addition or replacement of a valve.
(b)
maximum spacing between valves. rmvs and alternative equivalent technology must be installed in
accordance with the following requirements:
(1)
shut-off segment. for purposes of this section, a “shut-off segment” means the segment of pipeline
located between the upstream valve closest to the upstream endpoint of the replaced pipeline
segment in the hca or the pipeline segment that could affect an hca and the downstream valve
closest to the downstream endpoint of the replaced pipeline segment of the hca or the pipeline

segment that could affect an hca so that the entirety of the segment that could affect the hca or
the segment within the hca is between at least two rmvs or alternative equivalent technologies. if
any crossover or lateral pipe for commodity receipts or deliveries connects to the replaced segment
between the upstream and downstream valves, the shut-off segment also extends to a valve on the
crossover connection(s) or lateral(s), such that, when all valves are closed, there is no flow path for
commodity to be transported to the rupture site (except for residual liquids already in the shut-off
segment). multiple segments that could affect hcas or are in hcas may be contained within a
single shut-off segment. all entirely replaced onshore hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide pipeline
segments, as defined in § 195.2, that could affect or are in an hca must include a minimum of one
valve that meets the requirements of this section and section 195.419. the operator is not required
to select the closest valve to the shut-off segment as the rmv or alternative equivalent technology.
an operator may use a manual pump station valve at a continuously manned station as an
alternative equivalent technology. such a manual valve used as an alternative equivalent technology
would not require a notification to phmsa in accordance with § 195.18.
(2)
shut-off segment valve spacing. pipeline segments subject to paragraph (a) of this section must be
protected on the upstream and downstream side with rmvs or alternative equivalent technologies.
the distance between rmvs or alternative equivalent technologies must not exceed:
(i)
for pipeline segments carrying non-highly volatile liquids (hvl): 15 miles, with a maximum
distance not to exceed 71⁄2 miles from the endpoints of a shut-off segment: or
(ii)
for pipeline segments carrying hvls: 71⁄2 miles. the maximum valve spacing intervals for
these valves may be increased by 1.25 times the spacing distance, up to a 93⁄8-mile spacing at
an endpoint, provided the operator notify phmsa in accordance with § 195.260 (g).
(3)
laterals. laterals extending from shut-off segments that contribute less than 5 percent of the total
shut-off segment volume may have rmvs or alternative equivalent technologies that meet the
actuation requirements of this section at locations other than mainline receipt/delivery points, as
long as all of these laterals contributing hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide volumes to the shut-off
segment do not contribute more than 5 percent of the total shut-off segment volume, based upon
maximum flow volume at the operating pressure. a check valve may be used as an alternative
equivalent technology where it is positioned to stop flow into the lateral. check valves used as an
alternative equivalent technology in accordance with this paragraph (b)(3) are not subject to §
195.419 but must be inspected, operated, and remediated in accordance with § 195.420, including
for closure and leakage, to ensure operational reliability. an operator using such a valve as an
alternative equivalent technology must submit a request to phmsa in accordance with § 195.18.
(4)
crossovers. an operator may use a manual valve as an alternative equivalent technology for a
crossover connection if, during normal operations, the valve is closed to prevent the flow of
hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide with a locking device or other means designed to prevent the
opening of the valve by persons other than those authorized by the operator. the operator must
document that the valve has been closed and locked in accordance with the operator's lock-out and
tag-out procedures to prevent the flow of hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide. an operator using a
such a valve as an alternative equivalent technology must submit a request to phmsa in accordance
with § 195.18.
(c)
manual operation upon identification of a rupture. operators using a manual valve as an alternative
equivalent technology pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section must develop and implement operating
procedures and appropriately designate and locate nearby personnel to ensure valve shut-off in
accordance with this section and § 195.419. manual operation of valves must include time for the

(a)
scope. the requirements in this section apply to rupture-mitigation valves (rmv), as defined in § 195.2, or
alternative equivalent technology, installed pursuant to §§ 195.258 and 195.418.
(b)
rupture identification and valve shut-off time. if an operator observes or is notified of a release of
hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide that may be representative of an unintentional or uncontrolled release
event meeting a notification of potential rupture (see §§ 195.2 and 195.417), including any unexplained
flow rate changes, pressure changes, equipment functions, or other pipeline instrumentation indications
observed by the operator, the operator must, as soon as practicable but within 30 minutes of rupture
identification (see § 195.402(e)(4)), identify the rupture and fully close any rmvs or alternative equivalent
technologies necessary to minimize the volume of hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide released from a
pipeline and mitigate the consequences of a rupture.
(c)
valve shut-off capability. a valve must have the actuation capability necessary to close an rmv or
alternative equivalent technology to mitigate the consequences of a rupture in accordance with the
requirements of this section.
(d)
valve monitoring and operational capabilities. an rmv, as defined in § 195.2, or alternative equivalent
technology, must be capable of being monitored or controlled by either remote or onsite personnel as
follows:
(1)
operated during normal, abnormal, and emergency operating conditions;
(2)
monitored for valve status (i.e., open, closed, or partial closed/open), upstream pressure, and
downstream pressure. for automatic shut-off valves (asv), an operator does not need to monitor
remotely a valve's status if the operator has the capability to monitor pressures or flow rate within
each pipeline segment located between rmvs or alternative equivalent technologies to identify and
locate a rupture. pipeline segments that use an alternative equivalent technology must have the
capability to monitor pressures and hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide flow rates on the pipeline in
order to identify and locate a rupture; and
(3)
have a back-up power source to maintain supervisory control and data acquisition (scada) systems
or other remote communications for remote-control valve (rcv) or asv operational status or be
monitored and controlled by on-site personnel.
(e)
monitoring of valve shut-off response status. the position and operational status of an rmv must be
appropriately monitored through electronic communication with remote instrumentation or other
equivalent means. an operator does not need to monitor remotely an asv's status if the operator has the
capability to monitor pressures or hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide s flow rate on the pipeline to identify
and locate a rupture.

§ 195.420 valve maintenance.
(f)
flow modeling for automatic shut-off valves. prior to using an asv as an rmv, the operator must conduct
flow modeling for the shut-off segment and any laterals that feed the shut-off segment, so that the valve
will close within 30 minutes or less following rupture identification, consistent with the operator's
procedures, and in accordance with § 195.2 and this section. the flow modeling must include the
anticipated maximum, normal, or any other flow volumes, pressures, or other operating conditions that
may be encountered during the year, not to exceed a period of 15 months, and it must be modeled for the
flow between the rmvs or alternative equivalent technologies, and any looped pipelines or hazardous
liquid or carbon dioxide receipt tie-ins. if operating conditions change that could affect the asv set
pressures and the 30-minute valve closure time following a notification of potential rupture, as defined at
§ 195.2, an operator must conduct a new flow model and reset the asv set pressures prior to the next
review for asv set pressures in accordance with § 195.420. the flow model must include a time/pressure
chart for the segment containing the asv if a rupture event occurs. an operator must conduct this flow
modeling prior to making flow condition changes in a manner that could render the 30-minute valve
closure time unachievable.
(g)
pipelines not affecting hcas. for pipeline segments that are not in a high-consequence area (hca) or that
could not affect an hca, an operator submitting a notification pursuant to §§ 195.18 and 195.258 for use
of manual valves as an alternative equivalent technology may also request an exemption from the valve
operation requirements of § 195.419(b).
(h)
exception. the requirements of this section do not apply to gathering lines.
(a)
each operator shall maintain each valve that is necessary for the safe operation of its pipeline systems in
good working order at all times.
(b)
each operator must, at least twice each calendar year, but at intervals not exceeding 71⁄2 months, inspect
each mainline valve to determine that it is functioning properly. each rupture-mitigation valve (rmv), as
defined in § 195.2 and not contained in a gathering line, or alternative equivalent technology that is
installed under § 195.258(c) or § 195.418, must also be partially operated. operators are not required to
close the valve fully during the inspection; a minimum 25 percent valve closure is sufficient to
demonstrate compliance, unless the operator has operational information that requires an additional
closure percentage for maintaining reliability.
(c)
each operator shall provide protection for each valve from unauthorized operation and from vandalism.
(d)
for each remote-control valve (rcv) installed in accordance with § 195.258(c) or § 195.418, an operator
must conduct a point-to-point verification between scada system displays and the installed valves,
sensors, and communications equipment, in accordance with § 195.446(c) and (e).
(e)
for each alternative equivalent technology installed under § 195.258(c) or (d) or § 195.418(a) that is
manually or locally operated (i.e., not an rmv, as that term is defined in § 195.2):
(1)
operators must achieve a response time of 30 minutes or less, as required by § 195.419(b), through
an initial drill and through periodic validation as required by paragraph (e)(2) of this section. an
operator must review each phase of the drill response and document the results to validate the total
response time, including the identification of a rupture, and valve shut-off time as being less than or
equal to 30 minutes after rupture identification.

§ 195.422 pipeline repairs.
(2)
within each pipeline system, and within each operating or maintenance field work unit, operators
must randomly select an authorized rupture-mitigation alternative equivalent technology for an
annual 30-minute-total response time validation drill simulating worst-case conditions for that
location to ensure compliance with § 195.419. operators are not required to close the alternative
equivalent technology fully during the drill; a minimum 25 percent valve closure is sufficient to
demonstrate compliance with the drill requirements unless the operator has operational information
that requires an additional closure percentage for maintaining reliability. the response drill must
occur at least once each calendar year, at intervals not to exceed 15 months. operators must include
in their written procedures the method they use to randomly select which alternative equivalent
technology is tested in accordance with this paragraph.
(3)
if the 30-minute-maximum response time cannot be achieved in the drill, the operator must revise
response efforts to achieve compliance with § 195.419 no later than 12 months after the drill.
alternative valve shut-off measures must be in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section within 7
days of the drill.
(4)
based on the results of the response-time drills, the operator must include lessons learned in:
(i)
training and qualifications programs;
(ii)
design, construction, testing, maintenance, operating, and emergency procedures manuals; and
(iii) any other areas identified by the operator as needing improvement.
(f)
each operator must implement remedial measures as follows to correct any valve installed on an onshore
pipeline in accordance with § 195.258(c), or an rmv or alternative equivalent technology installed in
accordance with § 195.418, that is indicated to be inoperable or unable to maintain effective shut-off:
(1)
repair or replace the valve as soon as practicable but no later than 12 months after finding that the
valve is inoperable or unable to maintain shut-off. an operator may request an extension of the
compliance deadline requirements of this section if it can demonstrate to phmsa, in accordance
with the notification procedures in § 195.18, that repairing or replacing a valve within 12 months
would be economically, technically, or operationally infeasible; and
(2)
designate an alternative compliant valve within 7 calendar days of the finding while repairs are being
made and document an interim response plan to maintain safety. alternative compliant valves are
not required to comply with valve spacing requirements of this part.
(g)
an operator using an asv as an rmv, in accordance with §§ 195.2, 195.260, 195.418, and 195.419, must
document, in accordance with § 195.419(f), and confirm the asv shut-in pressures on a calendar year
basis not to exceed 15 months. asv shut-in set pressures must be proven and reset individually at each
asv, as required by § 195.419(f), at least each calendar year, but at intervals not to exceed 15 months.
(h)
the requirements of paragraphs (d) through (g) of this section do not apply to gathering lines.
(a)
each operator shall, in repairing its pipeline systems, insure that the repairs are made in a safe manner
and are made so as to prevent damage to persons or property.

§ 195.446 control room management.
(a)
scope. except for offshore gathering and regulated rural gathering pipelines, this section applies to all
hazardous liquid pipelines transporting liquid in single phase (without gas in the liquid).
(b)
general. a pipeline must have an effective system for detecting leaks in accordance with §§ 195.134 or
195.452, as appropriate. an operator must evaluate the capability of its leak detection system to protect
the public, property, and the environment and modify it as necessary to do so. at a minimum, an
operator's evaluation must consider the following factors—length and size of the pipeline, type of product
carried, the swiftness of leak detection, location of nearest response personnel, and leak history.
(c)
cpm leak detection systems. each computational pipeline monitoring (cpm) leak detection system
installed on a hazardous liquid pipeline must comply with api rp 1130 (incorporated by reference, see §
195.3) in operating, maintaining, testing, record keeping, and dispatcher training of the system.
(a)
general. this section applies to each operator of a pipeline facility with a controller working in a control
room who monitors and controls all or part of a pipeline facility through a scada system. each operator
must have and follow written control room management procedures that implement the requirements of
this section. the procedures required by this section must be integrated, as appropriate, with the
operator's written procedures required by § 195.402. an operator must develop the procedures no later
than august 1, 2011, and must implement the procedures according to the following schedule. the
procedures required by paragraphs (b), (c)(5), (d)(2) and (d)(3), (f) and (g) of this section must be
implemented no later than october 1, 2011. the procedures required by paragraphs (c)(1) through (4),
(d)(1), (d)(4), and (e) must be implemented no later than august 1, 2012. the training procedures required
by paragraph (h) must be implemented no later than august 1, 2012, except that any training required by
another paragraph of this section must be implemented no later than the deadline for that paragraph.
(b)
roles and responsibilities. each operator must define the roles and responsibilities of a controller during
normal, abnormal, and emergency operating conditions. to provide for a controller's prompt and
appropriate response to operating conditions, an operator must define each of the following:
(1)
a controller's authority and responsibility to make decisions and take actions during normal
operations;
(2)
a controller's role when an abnormal operating condition is detected, even if the controller is not the
first to detect the condition, including the controller's responsibility to take specific actions and to
communicate with others;
(3)
a controller's role during an emergency, even if the controller is not the first to detect the emergency,
including the controller's responsibility to take specific actions and to communicate with others;
(4)
a method of recording controller shift-changes and any hand-over of responsibility between
controllers; and
(5)
the roles, responsibilities and qualifications of others who have the authority to direct or supersede
the specific technical actions of controllers.

processes and procedures necessary for the controllers to carry out the roles and responsibilities the
operator has defined by performing each of the following:
(1)
implement api rp 1165 (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3) whenever a scada system is
added, expanded or replaced, unless the operator demonstrates that certain provisions of api rp
1165 are not practical for the scada system used;
(2)
conduct a point-to-point verification between scada displays and related field equipment when field
equipment is added or moved and when other changes that affect pipeline safety are made to field
equipment or scada displays;
(3)
test and verify an internal communication plan to provide adequate means for manual operation of
the pipeline safely, at least once each calendar year, but at intervals not to exceed 15 months;
(4)
test any backup scada systems at least once each calendar year, but at intervals not to exceed 15
months; and
(5)
implement section 5 of api rp 1168 (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3) to establish procedures
for when a different controller assumes responsibility, including the content of information to be
exchanged.
(d)
fatigue mitigation. each operator must implement the following methods to reduce the risk associated
with controller fatigue that could inhibit a controller's ability to carry out the roles and responsibilities the
operator has defined:
(1)
establish shift lengths and schedule rotations that provide controllers off-duty time sufficient to
achieve eight hours of continuous sleep;
(2)
educate controllers and supervisors in fatigue mitigation strategies and how off-duty activities
contribute to fatigue;
(3)
train controllers and supervisors to recognize the effects of fatigue; and
(4)
establish a maximum limit on controller hours-of-service, which may provide for an emergency
deviation from the maximum limit if necessary for the safe operation of a pipeline facility.
(e)
alarm management. each operator using a scada system must have a written alarm management plan to
provide for effective controller response to alarms. an operator's plan must include provisions to:
(1)
review scada safety-related alarm operations using a process that ensures alarms are accurate
and support safe pipeline operations;
(2)
identify at least once each calendar month points affecting safety that have been taken off scan in
the scada host, have had alarms inhibited, generated false alarms, or that have had forced or
manual values for periods of time exceeding that required for associated maintenance or operating
activities;
(3)
verify the correct safety-related alarm set-point values and alarm descriptions when associated field
instruments are calibrated or changed and at least once each calendar year, but at intervals not to
exceed 15 months;

at least once each calendar year, but at intervals not exceeding 15 months, that will assure
controllers have sufficient time to analyze and react to incoming alarms; and
(6)
address deficiencies identified through the implementation of paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(5) of
this section.
(f)
change management. each operator must assure that changes that could affect control room operations
are coordinated with the control room personnel by performing each of the following:
(1)
implement section 7 of api rp 1168 (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3) for control room
management change and require coordination between control room representatives, operator's
management, and associated field personnel when planning and implementing physical changes to
pipeline equipment or configuration; and
(2)
require its field personnel to contact the control room when emergency conditions exist and when
making field changes that affect control room operations.
(g)
operating experience. each operator must assure that lessons learned from its operating experience are
incorporated, as appropriate, into its control room management procedures by performing each of the
following:
(1)
review accidents that must be reported pursuant to § 195.50 and 195.52 to determine if control
room actions contributed to the event and, if so, correct, where necessary, deficiencies related to:
(i)
controller fatigue;
(ii)
field equipment;
(iii) the operation of any relief device;
(iv) procedures;
(v)
scada system configuration; and
(vi) scada system performance.
(2)
include lessons learned from the operator's experience in the training program required by this
section.
(h)
training. each operator must establish a controller training program and review the training program
content to identify potential improvements at least once each calendar year, but at intervals not to exceed
15 months. an operator's program must provide for training each controller to carry out the roles and
responsibilities defined by the operator. in addition, the training program must include the following
elements:
(1)
responding to abnormal operating conditions likely to occur simultaneously or in sequence;
(2)
use of a computerized simulator or non-computerized (tabletop) method for training controllers to
recognize abnormal operating conditions;

include in the program a framework that—
(i)
addresses each element of the integrity management program under paragraph (f) of this
section, including continual integrity assessment and evaluation under paragraph (j) of this
section; and
(ii)

(5)
implement and follow the program.
(6)
follow recognized industry practices in carrying out this section, unless—
(i)
this section specifies otherwise; or
(ii)
the operator demonstrates that an alternative practice is supported by a reliable engineering
evaluation and provides an equivalent level of public safety and environmental protection.
(c)
what must be in the baseline assessment plan?
(1)
an operator must include each of the following elements in its written baseline assessment plan:
(i)
the methods selected to assess the integrity of the line pipe. an operator must assess the
integrity of the line pipe by in-line inspection tool(s) described in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(a) of this
section for the range of relevant threats to the pipeline segment. if it is impracticable based
upon the construction of the pipeline (e.g., diameter changes, sharp bends, and elbows) or
operational limits including operating pressure, low flow, pipeline length, or availability of in-line
inspection tool technology for the pipe diameter, then the operator must use the appropriate
method(s) in paragraphs (c)(1)(i)(b), (c), or (d) of this section for the range of relevant threats
to the pipeline segment. the methods an operator selects to assess low-frequency electric
resistance welded pipe, pipe with a seam factor less than 1.0 as defined in § 195.106(e) or lap-
welded pipe susceptible to longitudinal seam failure, must be capable of assessing seam
integrity, cracking, and of detecting corrosion and deformation anomalies.
(a)
in-line inspection tool or tools capable of detecting corrosion and deformation anomalies
including dents, gouges, and grooves. for pipeline segments with an identified or probable
risk or threat related to cracks (such as at pipe body or weld seams) based on the risk
factors specified in paragraph (e), an operator must use an in-line inspection tool or tools
capable of detecting crack anomalies. when performing an assessment using an in-line
inspection tool, an operator must comply with § 195.591. an operator using this method
must explicitly consider uncertainties in reported results (including tool tolerance,
anomaly findings, and unity chart plots or equivalent for determining uncertainties) in
identifying anomalies;
(b)
pressure test conducted in accordance with subpart e of this part;

page 85 of 123

(c)
external corrosion direct assessment in accordance with § 195.588; or
(d)
other technology that the operator demonstrates can provide an equivalent understanding
of the condition of the line pipe. an operator choosing this option must notify the office of
pipeline safety (ops) 90 days before conducting the assessment, by sending a notice to
the address or facsimile number specified in paragraph (m) of this section.
(ii)
a schedule for completing the integrity assessment;
(iii) an explanation of the assessment methods selected and evaluation of risk factors considered
in establishing the assessment schedule.
(2)
an operator must document, prior to implementing any changes to the plan, any modification to the
plan, and reasons for the modification.
(d)
when must operators complete baseline assessments?
(1)
all pipelines. an operator must complete the baseline assessment before a new or conversion-to-
service pipeline begins operation through the development of procedures, identification of high
consequence areas, and pressure testing of could-affect high consequence areas in accordance
with § 195.304.
(2)
newly identified areas. if an operator obtains information (whether from the information analysis
required under paragraph (g) of this section, census bureau maps, or any other source)
demonstrating that the area around a pipeline segment has changed to meet the definition of a high
consequence area (see § 195.450), that area must be incorporated into the operator's baseline
assessment plan within 1 year from the date that the information is obtained. an operator must
complete the baseline assessment of any pipeline segment that could affect a newly identified high
consequence area within 5 years from the date an operator identifies the area.
(e)
what are the risk factors for establishing an assessment schedule (for both the baseline and continual
integrity assessments)?
(1)
an operator must establish an integrity assessment schedule that prioritizes pipeline segments for
assessment (see paragraphs (d)(1) and (j)(3) of this section). an operator must base the
assessment schedule on all risk factors that reflect the risk conditions on the pipeline segment. the
factors an operator must consider include, but are not limited to:
(i)
results of the previous integrity assessment, defect type and size that the assessment method
can detect, and defect growth rate;
(ii)
pipe size, material, manufacturing information, coating type and condition, and seam type;
(iii) leak history, repair history and cathodic protection history;
(iv) product transported;
(v)
operating stress level;
(vi) existing or projected activities in the area;
(vii) local environmental factors that could affect the pipeline (e.g., seismicity, corrosivity of soil,
subsidence, climatic);
(viii) geo-technical hazards; and

(ix) physical support of the segment such as by a cable suspension bridge.
(2)
appendix c of this part provides further guidance on risk factors.
(f)
what are the elements of an integrity management program? an integrity management program begins
with the initial framework. an operator must continually change the program to reflect operating
experience, conclusions drawn from results of the integrity assessments, and other maintenance and
surveillance data, and evaluation of consequences of a failure on the high consequence area. an operator
must include, at minimum, each of the following elements in its written integrity management program:
(1)
a process for identifying which pipeline segments could affect a high consequence area;
(2)
a baseline assessment plan meeting the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section;
(3)
an analysis that integrates all available information about the integrity of the entire pipeline and the
consequences of a failure (see paragraph (g) of this section);
(4)
criteria for remedial actions to address integrity issues raised by the assessment methods and
information analysis (see paragraph (h) of this section);
(5)
a continual process of assessment and evaluation to maintain a pipeline's integrity (see paragraph
(j) of this section);
(6)
identification of preventive and mitigative measures to protect the high consequence area (see
paragraph (i) of this section);
(7)
methods to measure the program's effectiveness (see paragraph (k) of this section);
(8)
a process for review of integrity assessment results and information analysis by a person qualified
to evaluate the results and information (see paragraph (h)(2) of this section).
(g)
what is an information analysis? in periodically evaluating the integrity of each pipeline segment (see
paragraph (j) of this section), an operator must analyze all available information about the integrity of its
entire pipeline and the consequences of a possible failure along the pipeline. operators must continue to
comply with the data integration elements specified in § 195.452(g) that were in effect on october 1,
2018, until october 1, 2022. operators must begin to integrate all the data elements specified in this
section starting october 1, 2020, with all attributes integrated by october 1, 2022. this analysis must:
(1)
integrate information and attributes about the pipeline that include, but are not limited to:
(i)
pipe diameter, wall thickness, grade, and seam type;
(ii)
pipe coating, including girth weld coating;
(iii) maximum operating pressure (mop) and temperature;
(iv) endpoints of segments that could affect high consequence areas (hcas);
(v)
hydrostatic test pressure including any test failures or leaks—if known;
(vi) location of casings and if shorted;
(vii) any in-service ruptures or leaks—including identified causes;
(viii) data gathered through integrity assessments required under this section;
(ix) close interval survey (cis) survey results;

page 87 of 123

(x)
depth of cover surveys;
(xi) corrosion protection (cp) rectifier readings;
(xii) cp test point survey readings and locations;
(xiii) ac/dc and foreign structure interference surveys;
(xiv) pipe coating surveys and cathodic protection surveys.
(xv) results of examinations of exposed portions of buried pipelines (i.e., pipe and pipe coating
condition, see § 195.569);
(xvi) stress corrosion cracking (scc) and other cracking (pipe body or weld) excavations and
findings, including in-situ non-destructive examinations and analysis results for failure stress
pressures and cyclic fatigue crack growth analysis to estimate the remaining life of the pipeline;
(xvii) aerial photography;
(xviii) location of foreign line crossings;
(xix) pipe exposures resulting from repairs and encroachments;
(xx) seismicity of the area; and
(xxi) other pertinent information derived from operations and maintenance activities and any
additional tests, inspections, surveys, patrols, or monitoring required under this part.
(2)
consider information critical to determining the potential for, and preventing, damage due to
excavation, including current and planned damage prevention activities, and development or planned
development along the pipeline;
(3)
consider how a potential failure would affect high consequence areas, such as location of a water
intake.
(4)
identify spatial relationships among anomalous information (e.g., corrosion coincident with foreign
line crossings; evidence of pipeline damage where aerial photography shows evidence of
encroachment). storing the information in a geographic information system (gis), alone, is not
sufficient. an operator must analyze for interrelationships among the data.
(h)
what actions must an operator take to address integrity issues? —
(1)
general requirements. an operator must take prompt action to address all anomalous conditions in
the pipeline that the operator discovers through the integrity assessment or information analysis. in
addressing all conditions, an operator must evaluate all anomalous conditions and remediate those
that could reduce a pipeline's integrity, as required by this part. an operator must be able to
demonstrate that the remediation of the condition will ensure that the condition is unlikely to pose a
threat to the long-term integrity of the pipeline. an operator must comply with all other applicable
requirements in this part in remediating a condition. each operator must, in repairing its pipeline
systems, ensure that the repairs are made in a safe and timely manner and are made so as to
prevent damage to persons, property, or the environment. the calculation method(s) used for
anomaly evaluation must be applicable for the range of relevant threats.

(i)
temporary pressure reduction. an operator must notify phmsa, in accordance with paragraph
(m) of this section, if the operator cannot meet the schedule for evaluation and remediation
required under paragraph (h)(3) of this section and cannot provide safety through a temporary
reduction in operating pressure.
(ii)
long-term pressure reduction. when a pressure reduction exceeds 365 days, the operator must
notify phmsa in accordance with paragraph (m) of this section and explain the reasons for the
delay. an operator must also take further remedial action to ensure the safety of the pipeline.
(2)
discovery of condition. discovery of a condition occurs when an operator has adequate information
to determine that a condition presenting a potential threat to the integrity of the pipeline exists. an
operator must promptly, but no later than 180 days after an assessment, obtain sufficient
information about a condition to make that determination, unless the operator can demonstrate the
180-day interval is impracticable. if the operator believes that 180 days are impracticable to make a
determination about a condition found during an assessment, the pipeline operator must notify
phmsa in accordance with paragraph (m) of this section and provide an expected date when
adequate information will become available.
(3)
schedule for evaluation and remediation. an operator must complete remediation of a condition
according to a schedule prioritizing the conditions for evaluation and remediation. if an operator
cannot meet the schedule for any condition, the operator must explain the reasons why it cannot
meet the schedule and how the changed schedule will not jeopardize public safety or environmental
protection.
(4)
special requirements for scheduling remediation —
(i)
immediate repair conditions. an operator's evaluation and remediation schedule must provide
for immediate repair conditions. to maintain safety, an operator must temporarily reduce the
operating pressure or shut down the pipeline until the operator completes the repair of these
conditions. an operator must calculate the temporary reduction in operating pressure using the
formulas referenced in paragraph (h)(4)(i)(b) of this section. if no suitable remaining strength
calculation method can be identified, an operator must implement a minimum 20 percent or
greater operating pressure reduction, based on actual operating pressure for two months prior
to the date of inspection, until the anomaly is repaired. an operator must treat the following
conditions as immediate repair conditions:
(a)
metal loss greater than 80% of nominal wall regardless of dimensions.
(b)
a calculation of the remaining strength of the pipe shows a predicted burst pressure less
than the established maximum operating pressure at the location of the anomaly. suitable
remaining strength calculation methods include, but are not limited to, asme/ansi b31g
(incorporated by reference, see § 195.3) and prci pr-3-805 (r-streng) (incorporated by
reference, see § 195.3).
(c)
a dent located on the top of the pipeline (above the 4 and 8 o'clock positions) that has any
indication of metal loss, cracking or a stress riser.
(d)
a dent located on the top of the pipeline (above the 4 and 8 o'clock positions) with a depth
greater than 6% of the nominal pipe diameter.
(e)
an anomaly that in the judgment of the person designated by the operator to evaluate the
assessment results requires immediate action.

(ii)
60-day conditions. except for conditions listed in paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section, an operator
must schedule evaluation and remediation of the following conditions within 60 days of
discovery of condition.
(a)
a dent located on the top of the pipeline (above the 4 and 8 o'clock positions) with a depth
greater than 3% of the pipeline diameter (greater than 0.250 inches in depth for a pipeline
diameter less than nominal pipe size (nps) 12).
(b)
a dent located on the bottom of the pipeline that has any indication of metal loss, cracking
or a stress riser.
(iii) 180-day conditions. except for conditions listed in paragraph (h)(4)(i) or (ii) of this section, an
operator must schedule evaluation and remediation of the following within 180 days of
discovery of the condition:
(a)

pipeline diameter less than nps 12) that affects pipe curvature at a girth weld or a
longitudinal seam weld.
(b)
a dent located on the top of the pipeline (above 4 and 8 o'clock position) with a depth
greater than 2% of the pipeline's diameter (0.250 inches in depth for a pipeline diameter
less than nps 12).
(c)
a dent located on the bottom of the pipeline with a depth greater than 6% of the pipeline's
diameter.
(d)
a calculation of the remaining strength of the pipe shows an operating pressure that is
less than the current established maximum operating pressure at the location of the
anomaly. suitable remaining strength calculation methods include, but are not limited to,

a potential crack indication that when excavated is determined to be a crack.
(h) corrosion of or along a longitudinal seam weld.
(i)
a gouge or groove greater than 12.5% of nominal wall.
(iv) other conditions. in addition to the conditions listed in paragraphs (h)(4)(i) through (iii) of this

the condition for remediation. appendix c of this part contains guidance concerning other
conditions that an operator should evaluate.
(i)
what preventive and mitigative measures must an operator take to protect the high consequence area? —
(1)
general requirements. an operator must take measures to prevent and mitigate the consequences of
a pipeline failure that could affect a high consequence area. these measures include conducting a
risk analysis of the pipeline segment to identify additional actions to enhance public safety or
environmental protection. such actions may include, but are not limited to, implementing damage

prevention best practices, better monitoring of cathodic protection where corrosion is a concern,
establishing shorter inspection intervals, installing efrds on the pipeline segment, modifying the
systems that monitor pressure and detect leaks, providing additional training to personnel on
response procedures, conducting drills with local emergency responders and adopting other
management controls.
(2)
risk analysis criteria. in identifying the need for additional preventive and mitigative measures, an
operator must evaluate the likelihood of a pipeline release occurring and how a release could affect
the high consequence area. this determination must consider all relevant risk factors, including, but
not limited to:
(i)
terrain surrounding the pipeline segment, including drainage systems such as small streams
and other smaller waterways that could act as a conduit to the high consequence area;
(ii)
elevation profile;
(iii) characteristics of the product transported;
(iv) amount of product that could be released;
(v)
possibility of a spillage in a farm field following the drain tile into a waterway;
(vi) ditches along side a roadway the pipeline crosses;
(vii) physical support of the pipeline segment such as by a cable suspension bridge;
(viii) exposure of the pipeline to operating pressure exceeding established maximum operating
pressure;
(ix) seismicity of the area.
(3)
leak detection. an operator must have a means to detect leaks on its pipeline system. an operator
must evaluate the capability of its leak detection means and modify, as necessary, to protect the
high consequence area. an operator's evaluation must, at least, consider, the following
factors—length and size of the pipeline, type of product carried, the pipeline's proximity to the high
consequence area, the swiftness of leak detection, location of nearest response personnel, leak
history, and risk assessment results.
(4)
emergency flow restricting devices (efrd). if an operator determines that an efrd is needed on a
pipeline segment that is located in, or which could affect, a high-consequence area (hca) in the
event of a hazardous liquid pipeline release, an operator must install the efrd. in making this
determination, an operator must, at least, evaluate the following factors—the swiftness of leak
detection and pipeline shutdown capabilities, the type of commodity carried, the rate of potential
leakage, the volume that can be released, topography or pipeline profile, the potential for ignition,
proximity to power sources, location of nearest response personnel, specific terrain within the hca
or between the pipeline segment and the hca it could affect, and benefits expected by reducing the
spill size. an rmv installed under this paragraph (i)(4) must meet all of the other applicable
requirements in this part, provided that the requirement of this sentence does not apply to gathering
lines.
(i)
where efrds are installed on pipeline segments in hcas and that could affect hcas with
diameters of 6 inches or greater and that are placed into service or that have had 2 or more
miles of pipe replaced within 5 contiguous miles within a 24-month period after april 10, 2023,
the location, installation, actuation, operation, and maintenance of such efrds (including valve

actuators, personnel response, operational control centers, supervisory control and data
acquisition (scada), communications, and procedures) must meet the design, operation,
testing, maintenance, and rupture-mitigation requirements of §§ 195.258, 195.260, 195.402,
195.418, 195.419, and 195.420.
(ii)
the efrd analysis and assessments specified in this paragraph (i)(4) must be completed prior
to placing into service all onshore pipelines with diameters of 6 inches or greater and that are
constructed or that have had 2 or more miles of pipe within any 5 contiguous miles within any
24-month period replaced after april 10, 2023. implementation of efrd findings for rmvs must
meet § 195.418.
(iii) an operator may request an exemption from the compliance deadline requirements of this
section if it can demonstrate to phmsa, in accordance with the notification procedures in §
195.18, that installing an efrd by that compliance deadline would be economically, technically,
or operationally infeasible.
(iv) the requirements of paragraphs (i)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section do not apply to gathering
lines.
(j)
what is a continual process of evaluation and assessment to maintain a pipeline's integrity? —
(1)
general. after completing the baseline integrity assessment, an operator must continue to assess
the line pipe at specified intervals and periodically evaluate the integrity of each pipeline segment
that could affect a high consequence area.
(2)
verifying covered segments. an operator must verify the risk factors used in identifying pipeline
segments that could affect a high consequence area on at least an annual basis not to exceed 15
months (appendix c of this part provides additional guidance on factors that can influence whether
a pipeline segment could affect a high consequence area). if a change in circumstance indicates
that the prior consideration of a risk factor is no longer valid or that an operator should consider new
risk factors, an operator must perform a new integrity analysis and evaluation to establish the
endpoints of any previously identified covered segments. the integrity analysis and evaluation must
include consideration of the results of any baseline and periodic integrity assessments (see
paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this section), information analyses (see paragraph (g) of this
section), and decisions about remediation and preventive and mitigative actions (see paragraphs (h)
and (i) of this section). an operator must complete the first annual verification under this paragraph
no later than july 1, 2021.
(3)
assessment intervals. an operator must establish five-year intervals, not to exceed 68 months, for
continually assessing the line pipe's integrity. an operator must base the assessment intervals on
the risk the line pipe poses to the high consequence area to determine the priority for assessing the
pipeline segments. an operator must establish the assessment intervals based on the factors
specified in paragraph (e) of this section, the analysis of the results from the last integrity
assessment, and the information analysis required by paragraph (g) of this section.
(4)
variance from the 5-year intervals in limited situations —
(i)
engineering basis. an operator may be able to justify an engineering basis for a longer
assessment interval on a segment of line pipe. the justification must be supported by a reliable
engineering evaluation combined with the use of other technology, such as external monitoring
technology, that provides an understanding of the condition of the line pipe equivalent to that
which can be obtained from the assessment methods allowed in paragraph (j)(5) of this
49 cfr part 195 (up to date as of 2/26/2025)

49 cfr 195.452(i)(4)(ii)
49 cfr 195.452(j)(4)(i) (enhanced display)
page 92 of 123

section. an operator must notify ops 270 days before the end of the five-year (or less) interval
of the justification for a longer interval, and propose an alternative interval. an operator must
send the notice to the address specified in paragraph (m) of this section.
(ii)
unavailable technology. an operator may require a longer assessment period for a segment of
line pipe (for example, because sophisticated internal inspection technology is not available).
an operator must justify the reasons why it cannot comply with the required assessment period
and must also demonstrate the actions it is taking to evaluate the integrity of the pipeline
segment in the interim. an operator must notify ops 180 days before the end of the five-year
(or less) interval that the operator may require a longer assessment interval, and provide an
estimate of when the assessment can be completed. an operator must send a notice to the
address specified in paragraph (m) of this section.
(5)
assessment methods. an operator must assess the integrity of the line pipe by any of the following
methods. the methods an operator selects to assess low frequency electric resistance welded pipe
or lap welded pipe susceptible to longitudinal seam failure must be capable of assessing seam
integrity and of detecting corrosion and deformation anomalies.
(i)
in-line inspection tool or tools capable of detecting corrosion and deformation anomalies,
including dents, gouges, and grooves. for pipeline segments that are susceptible to cracks
(pipe body and weld seams), an operator must use an in-line inspection tool or tools capable of
detecting crack anomalies. when performing an assessment using an in-line inspection tool,
an operator must comply with § 195.591;
(ii)
pressure test conducted in accordance with subpart e of this part;
(iii) external corrosion direct assessment in accordance with § 195.588; or
(iv) other technology that the operator demonstrates can provide an equivalent understanding of
the condition of the line pipe. an operator choosing this option must notify ops 90 days before
conducting the assessment, by sending a notice to the address or facsimile number specified
in paragraph (m) of this section.
(k)
what methods to measure program effectiveness must be used? an operator's program must include
methods to measure whether the program is effective in assessing and evaluating the integrity of each
pipeline segment and in protecting the high consequence areas. see appendix c of this part for guidance
on methods that can be used to evaluate a program's effectiveness.
(l)
what records must an operator keep to demonstrate compliance?
(1)
an operator must maintain, for the useful life of the pipeline, records that demonstrate compliance
with the requirements of this subpart. at a minimum, an operator must maintain the following
records for review during an inspection:
(i)
a written integrity management program in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
(ii)
documents to support the decisions and analyses, including any modifications, justifications,
deviations and determinations made, variances, and actions taken, to implement and evaluate
each element of the integrity management program listed in paragraph (f) of this section.
(2)
see appendix c of this part for examples of records an operator would be required to keep.
(m) how does an operator notify phmsa? an operator must provide any notification required by this section
by:

(2)
general. an operator must ensure that each pipeline is modified to accommodate the passage of an
instrumented internal inspection device by july 2, 2040.
(3)
newly identified areas. if a pipeline could affect a newly identified high consequence area (see
paragraph (d)(2) of this section) after july 2, 2035, an operator must modify the pipeline to
accommodate the passage of an instrumented internal inspection device within 5 years of the date
of identification or before performing the baseline assessment, whichever is sooner.
(4)
lack of accommodation. an operator may file a petition under § 190.9 of this chapter for a finding
that the basic construction (i.e., length, diameter, operating pressure, or location) of a pipeline cannot
be modified to accommodate the passage of an instrumented internal inspection device or that the
operator determines it would abandon or shut-down a pipeline as a result of the cost to comply with
the requirement of this section.
(5)
emergencies. an operator may file a petition under § 190.9 of this chapter for a finding that a pipeline
cannot be modified to accommodate the passage of an instrumented internal inspection device as a
result of an emergency. an operator must file such a petition within 30 days after discovering the
emergency. if the petition is denied, the operator must modify the pipeline to allow the passage of an
instrumented internal inspection device within 1 year after the date of the notice of the denial.
(a)
pipeline integrity assessments using internal inspection technology appropriate for the integrity threats to
the pipeline are completed not less often than once every 12 months, and;
(b)
pipeline integrity assessments using pipeline route surveys, depth of cover surveys, pressure tests,
external corrosion direct assessment, or other technology that the operator demonstrates can further the
understanding of the condition of the pipeline facility, are completed on a schedule based on the risk that
the pipeline facility poses to the high consequence area in which the pipeline facility is located.

§ 195.569 do i have to examine exposed portions of buried pipelines?
whenever you have knowledge that any portion of a buried pipeline is exposed, you must examine the exposed
portion for evidence of external corrosion if the pipe is bare, or if the coating is deteriorated. if you find external
corrosion requiring corrective action under § 195.585, you must investigate circumferentially and longitudinally
beyond the exposed portion (by visual examination, indirect method, or both) to determine whether additional
corrosion requiring remedial action exists in the vicinity of the exposed portion.
§ 195.571 what criteria must i use to determine the adequacy of cathodic protection?
cathodic protection required by this subpart must comply with one or more of the applicable criteria and other
considerations for cathodic protection contained paragraphs 6.2.2, 6.2.3, 6.2.4, 6.2.5 and 6.3 in nace sp 0169
(incorporated by reference, see § 195.3).
[amdt. 195-100, 80 fr 12781, mar. 11, 2015]
§ 195.573 what must i do to monitor external corrosion control?
(1)
locate the leads at intervals frequent enough to obtain electrical measurements indicating the
adequacy of cathodic protection.
(2)
provide enough looping or slack so backfilling will not unduly stress or break the lead and the lead
will otherwise remain mechanically secure and electrically conductive.
(3)
prevent lead attachments from causing stress concentrations on pipe.
(4)
for leads installed in conduits, suitably insulate the lead from the conduit.
(5)
at the connection to the pipeline, coat each bared test lead wire and bared metallic area with an
electrical insulating material compatible with the pipe coating and the insulation on the wire.
(c)
maintenance. you must maintain the test lead wires in a condition that enables you to obtain electrical
measurements to determine whether cathodic protection complies with § 195.571.
(a)
protected pipelines. you must do the following to determine whether cathodic protection required by this
subpart complies with § 195.571:
(1)
conduct tests on the protected pipeline at least once each calendar year, but with intervals not
exceeding 15 months. however, if tests at those intervals are impractical for separately protected
short sections of bare or ineffectively coated pipelines, testing may be done at least once every 3
calendar years, but with intervals not exceeding 39 months.
(2)
identify not more than 2 years after cathodic protection is installed, the circumstances in which a
close-interval survey or comparable technology is practicable and necessary to accomplish the
objectives of paragraph 10.1.1.3 of nace sp 0169 (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3).
(b)
unprotected pipe. you must reevaluate your unprotected buried or submerged pipe and cathodically
protect the pipe in areas in which active corrosion is found, as follows:
(1)
determine the areas of active corrosion by electrical survey, or where an electrical survey is
impractical, by other means that include review and analysis of leak repair and inspection records,
corrosion monitoring records, exposed pipe inspection records, and the pipeline environment.

§ 195.577 what must i do to alleviate interference currents?
§ 195.579 what must i do to mitigate internal corrosion?
[amdt. 195-73, 66 fr 67004, dec. 27, 2001, as amended by amdt. 195-99, 80 fr 188, jan. 5, 2015]
(b)
you must install one or more insulating devices where electrical isolation of a portion of a pipeline is
necessary to facilitate the application of corrosion control.
(c)
you must inspect and electrically test each electrical isolation to assure the isolation is adequate.
(d)
if you install an insulating device in an area where a combustible atmosphere is reasonable to foresee,
you must take precautions to prevent arcing.
(e)
if a pipeline is in close proximity to electrical transmission tower footings, ground cables, or counterpoise,
or in other areas where it is reasonable to foresee fault currents or an unusual risk of lightning, you must
protect the pipeline against damage from fault currents or lightning and take protective measures at
insulating devices.
(a)
for pipelines exposed to stray currents, you must have a program to identify, test for, and minimize the
detrimental effects of such currents.
(b)
you must design and install each impressed current or galvanic anode system to minimize any adverse
effects on existing adjacent metallic structures.
(a)
general. if you transport any hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide that would corrode the pipeline, you must
investigate the corrosive effect of the hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide on the pipeline and take
adequate steps to mitigate internal corrosion.
(b)
inhibitors. if you use corrosion inhibitors to mitigate internal corrosion, you must—
(1)
use inhibitors in sufficient quantity to protect the entire part of the pipeline system that the inhibitors
are designed to protect;
(2)
use coupons or other monitoring equipment to determine the effectiveness of the inhibitors in
mitigating internal corrosion; and
(3)
examine the coupons or other monitoring equipment at least twice each calendar year, but with
intervals not exceeding 71⁄2 months.
(c)
removing pipe. whenever you remove pipe from a pipeline, you must inspect the internal surface of the
pipe for evidence of corrosion. if you find internal corrosion requiring corrective action under § 195.585,
you must investigate circumferentially and longitudinally beyond the removed pipe (by visual examination,
indirect method, or both) to determine whether additional corrosion requiring remedial action exists in the
vicinity of the removed pipe.
(d)
breakout tanks. after october 2, 2000, when you install a tank bottom lining in an aboveground breakout
tank built to api spec 12f (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3), api std 620 (incorporated by
reference, see § 195.3), api std 650 (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3), or api std 650's
predecessor, standard 12c, you must install the lining in accordance with api rp 652 (incorporated by
reference, see § 195.3). however, you don't need to comply with api rp 652 when installing any tank for
which you note in the corrosion control procedures established under § 195.402(c)(3) why compliance
with all or certain provisions of api rp 652 is not necessary for the safety of the tank.

§ 195.581 which pipelines must i protect against atmospheric corrosion and what coating
material may i use?
§ 195.583 what must i do to monitor atmospheric corrosion control?
if the pipeline is
located:
then the frequency of inspection is:
onshore
at least once every 3 calendar years, but with intervals not exceeding 39 months.
offshore
at least once each calendar year, but with intervals not exceeding 15 months.
§ 195.585 what must i do to correct corroded pipe?
(a)
you must clean and coat each pipeline or portion of pipeline that is exposed to the atmosphere, except
pipelines under paragraph (c) of this section.
(b)
coating material must be suitable for the prevention of atmospheric corrosion.
(c)
except portions of pipelines in offshore splash zones or soil-to-air interfaces, you need not protect against
atmospheric corrosion any pipeline for which you demonstrate by test, investigation, or experience
appropriate to the environment of the pipeline that corrosion will—
(1)
only be a light surface oxide; or
(2)
not affect the safe operation of the pipeline before the next scheduled inspection.
(a)
you must inspect each pipeline or portion of pipeline that is exposed to the atmosphere for evidence of
atmospheric corrosion, as follows:
(b)
during inspections you must give particular attention to pipe at soil-to-air interfaces, under thermal
insulation, under disbonded coatings, at pipe supports, in splash zones, at deck penetrations, and in
spans over water.
(c)
if you find atmospheric corrosion during an inspection, you must provide protection against the corrosion
as required by § 195.581.
(a)
general corrosion. if you find pipe so generally corroded that the remaining wall thickness is less than that
required for the maximum operating pressure of the pipeline, you must replace the pipe. however, you
need not replace the pipe if you—
(1)
reduce the maximum operating pressure commensurate with the strength of the pipe needed for
serviceability based on actual remaining wall thickness; or
(2)
repair the pipe by a method that reliable engineering tests and analyses show can permanently
restore the serviceability of the pipe.
(b)
localized corrosion pitting. if you find pipe that has localized corrosion pitting to a degree that leakage
might result, you must replace or repair the pipe, unless you reduce the maximum operating pressure
commensurate with the strength of the pipe based on actual remaining wall thickness in the pits.

under § 195.585, you may use the procedure in asme/ansi b31g (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3) or in
prci pr-3-805 (r-streng) (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3) to determine the strength of corroded pipe
based on actual remaining wall thickness. these procedures apply to corroded regions that do not penetrate the
pipe wall, subject to the limitations set out in the respective procedures.
[amdt. 195-99, 80 fr 188, jan. 5, 2015]
§ 195.588 what standards apply to direct assessment?
(a)
if you use direct assessment on an onshore pipeline to evaluate the effects of external corrosion or stress
corrosion cracking, you must follow the requirements of this section. this section does not apply to
methods associated with direct assessment, such as close interval surveys, voltage gradient surveys, or
examination of exposed pipelines, when used separately from the direct assessment process.
(b)
the requirements for performing external corrosion direct assessment are as follows:
(1)
general. you must follow the requirements of nace sp0502 (incorporated by reference, see §
195.3). also, you must develop and implement a external corrosion direct assessment (ecda) plan
that includes procedures addressing pre-assessment, indirect examination, direct examination, and
post-assessment.
(2)
pre-assessment. in addition to the requirements in section 3 of nace sp0502 (incorporated by
reference, see § 195.3), the ecda plan procedures for pre-assessment must include—
(i)
provisions for applying more restrictive criteria when conducting ecda for the first time on a
pipeline segment;
(ii)
the basis on which you select at least two different, but complementary, indirect assessment
tools to assess each ecda region; and
(iii) if you utilize an indirect inspection method not described in appendix a of nace sp0502
(incorporated by reference, see § 195.3), you must demonstrate the applicability, validation
basis, equipment used, application procedure, and utilization of data for the inspection method.
(3)
indirect examination. in addition to the requirements in section 4 of nace sp0502 (incorporated by
reference, see § 195.3), the procedures for indirect examination of the ecda regions must include—
(i)
provisions for applying more restrictive criteria when conducting ecda for the first time on a
pipeline segment;
(ii)
criteria for identifying and documenting those indications that must be considered for
excavation and direct examination, including at least the following:
(a)
the known sensitivities of assessment tools;
(b)
the procedures for using each tool; and
(c)
the approach to be used for decreasing the physical spacing of indirect assessment tool
readings when the presence of a defect is suspected;
(iii) for each indication identified during the indirect examination, criteria for—
(a)
defining the urgency of excavation and direct examination of the indication; and

page 104 of 123

(b)
defining the excavation urgency as immediate, scheduled, or monitored; and
(iv) criteria for scheduling excavations of indications in each urgency level.
(4)
direct examination. in addition to the requirements in section 5 of nace sp0502 (incorporated by
reference, see § 195.3), the procedures for direct examination of indications from the indirect
examination must include—
(i)
provisions for applying more restrictive criteria when conducting ecda for the first time on a
pipeline segment;
(ii)
criteria for deciding what action should be taken if either:
(a)
corrosion defects are discovered that exceed allowable limits (section 5.5.2.2 of nace
sp0502 (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3) provides guidance for criteria); or
(b)
root cause analysis reveals conditions for which ecda is not suitable (section 5.6.2 of
nace sp0502 (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3) provides guidance for criteria);
(iii) criteria and notification procedures for any changes in the ecda plan, including changes that
affect the severity classification, the priority of direct examination, and the time frame for direct
examination of indications; and
(iv) criteria that describe how and on what basis you will reclassify and re-prioritize any of the
provisions specified in section 5.9 of nace sp0502 (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3).
(5)
post assessment and continuing evaluation. in addition to the requirements in section 6 of nace sp
0502 (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3), the procedures for post assessment of the
effectiveness of the ecda process must include—
(i)
measures for evaluating the long-term effectiveness of ecda in addressing external corrosion
in pipeline segments; and
(ii)
criteria for evaluating whether conditions discovered by direct examination of indications in
each ecda region indicate a need for reassessment of the pipeline segment at an interval less
than that specified in sections 6.2 and 6.3 of nace sp0502 (see appendix d of nace sp0502)
(incorporated by reference, see § 195.3).
(c)
if you use direct assessment on an onshore pipeline to evaluate the effects of stress corrosion cracking,
you must develop and follow a stress corrosion cracking direct assessment plan that meets all
requirements and recommendations of nace sp0204 (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3) and that
implements all four steps of the stress corrosion cracking direct assessment process including pre-
assessment, indirect inspection, detailed examination and post-assessment. as specified in nace
sp0204, section 1.1.7, stress corrosion cracking direct assessment is complementary with other
inspection methods such as in-line inspection or hydrostatic testing and is not necessarily an alternative
or replacement for these methods in all instances. in addition, the plan must provide for—
(1)
data gathering and integration. an operator's plan must provide for a systematic process to collect
and evaluate data to identify whether the conditions for stress corrosion cracking are present and to
prioritize the segments for assessment in accordance with nace sp0204, sections 3 and 4, and
table 1. this process must also include gathering and evaluating data related to scc at all sites an
operator excavates during the conduct of its pipeline operations (both within and outside covered
segments) where the criteria in nace sp0204 indicate the potential for stress corrosion cracking

direct assessment. this data gathering process must be conducted in accordance with nace
sp0204, section 5.3, and must include, at a minimum, all data listed in nace sp0204, table 2.
further, an operator must analyze the following factors as part of this evaluation:
(i)
the effects of a carbonate-bicarbonate environment, including the implications of any factors
that promote the production of a carbonate-bicarbonate environment such as soil temperature,
moisture, factors that affect the rate of carbon dioxide generation, and/or cathodic protection.
(ii)
the effects of cyclic loading conditions on the susceptibility and propagation of scc in both
high-ph and near-neutral-ph environments.
(iii) the effects of variations in applied cathodic protection such as overprotection, cathodic
protection loss for extended periods, and high negative potentials.
(iv) the effects of coatings that shield cathodic protection when disbonded from the pipe.
(v)
other factors that affect the mechanistic properties associated with scc including but not
limited to operating pressures, high tensile residual stresses, and the presence of sulfides.
(2)
indirect inspection. in addition to the requirements and recommendations of nace sp0204, section
4, the plan's procedures for indirect inspection must include provisions for conducting at least two
different, but complementary, indirect assessment electrical surveys, and the basis on the selections
as the most appropriate for the pipeline segment based on the data gathering and integration step.
(3)
direct examination. in addition to the requirements and recommendations of nace sp0204, section
5, the plan's procedures for direct examination must provide for conducting a minimum of four direct
examinations within the scc segment at locations determined to be the most likely for scc to occur.
(4)
remediation and mitigation. if any indication of scc is discovered in a segment, an operator must
mitigate the threat in accordance with one of the following applicable methods:
(i)
non-significant scc, as defined by nace sp0204, may be mitigated by either hydrostatic
testing in accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, or by grinding out with
verification by non-destructive examination (nde) methods that the scc defect is removed and
repairing the pipe. if grinding is used for repair, the remaining strength of the pipe at the repair
location must be determined using asme/ansi b31g or rstreng (incorporated by reference,
see § 195.3) and must be sufficient to meet the design requirements of subpart c of this part.
(ii)
significant scc must be mitigated using a hydrostatic testing program with a minimum test
pressure between 100% up to 110% of the specified minimum yield strength for a 30-minute
spike test immediately followed by a pressure test in accordance with subpart e of this part.
the test pressure for the entire sequence must be continuously maintained for at least 8 hours,
in accordance with subpart e of this part. any test failures due to scc must be repaired by
replacement of the pipe segment, and the segment retested until the pipe passes the complete
test without leakage. pipe segments that have scc present, but that pass the pressure test,
may be repaired by grinding in accordance with paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section.
(5)
post assessment. in addition to the requirements and recommendations of nace sp0204, sections
6.3, periodic reassessment, and 6.4, effectiveness of stress corrosion cracking direct assessment,
the plan's procedures for post assessment must include development of a reassessment plan based
on the susceptibility of the operator's pipe to stress corrosion cracking as well as on the behavior
mechanism of identified cracking. factors to be considered include, but are not limited to:

appendix a to part 195—delineation between federal and state jurisdiction—statement of
agency policy and interpretation
in 1979, congress enacted comprehensive safety legislation governing the transportation of hazardous liquids by
pipeline, the hazardous liquids pipeline safety act of 1979, 49 u.s.c. 2001 et seq. (hlpsa). the hlpsa expanded
the existing statutory authority for safety regulation, which was limited to transportation by common carriers in
interstate and foreign commerce, to transportation through facilities used in or affecting interstate or foreign
commerce. it also added civil penalty, compliance order, and injunctive enforcement authorities to the existing
criminal sanctions. modeled largely on the natural gas pipeline safety act of 1968, 49 u.s.c. 1671 et seq. (ngpsa),
the hlpsa provides for a national hazardous liquid pipeline safety program with nationally uniform minimal
standards and with enforcement administered through a federal-state partnership. the hlpsa leaves to exclusive
federal regulation and enforcement the “interstate pipeline facilities,” those used for the pipeline transportation of
hazardous liquids in interstate or foreign commerce. for the remainder of the pipeline facilities, denominated
“intrastate pipeline facilities,” the hlpsa provides that the same federal regulation and enforcement will apply
unless a state certifies that it will assume those responsibilities. a certified state must adopt the same minimal
standards but may adopt additional more stringent standards so long as they are compatible. therefore, in states
which participate in the hazardous liquid pipeline safety program through certification, it is necessary to distinguish
the interstate from the intrastate pipeline facilities.
in deciding that an administratively practical approach was necessary in distinguishing between interstate and
intrastate liquid pipeline facilities and in determining how best to accomplish this, dot has logically examined the
approach used in the ngpsa. the ngpsa defines the interstate gas pipeline facilities subject to exclusive federal
jurisdiction as those subject to the economic regulatory jurisdiction of the federal energy regulatory commission
(ferc). experience has proven this approach practical. unlike the ngpsa however, the hlpsa has no specific
reference to ferc jurisdiction, but instead defines interstate liquid pipeline facilities by the more commonly used
means of specifying the end points of the transportation involved. for example, the economic regulatory jurisdiction
of ferc over the transportation of both gas and liquids by pipeline is defined in much the same way. in
implementing the hlpsa dot has sought a practicable means of distinguishing between interstate and intrastate
pipeline facilities that provide the requisite degree of certainty to federal and state enforcement personnel and to
the regulated entities. dot intends that this statement of agency policy and interpretation provide that certainty.
in 1981, dot decided that the inventory of liquid pipeline facilities identified as subject to the jurisdiction of ferc
approximates the hlpsa category of “interstate pipeline facilities.” administrative use of the ferc inventory has
the added benefit of avoiding the creation of a separate federal scheme for determination of jurisdiction over the
same regulated entities. dot recognizes that the ferc inventory is only an approximation and may not be totally
satisfactory without some modification. the difficulties stem from some significant differences in the economic
regulation of liquid and of natural gas pipelines. there is an affirmative assertion of jurisdiction by ferc over
natural gas pipelines through the issuance of certificates of public convenience and necessity prior to commencing
operations. with liquid pipelines, there is only a rebuttable presumption of jurisdiction created by the filing by
pipeline operators of tariffs (or concurrences) for movement of liquids through existing facilities. although ferc
does police the filings for such matters as compliance with the general duties of common carriers, the question of
jurisdiction is normally only aired upon complaint. while any person, including state or federal agencies, can avail
themselves of the ferc forum by use of the complaint process, that process has only been rarely used to review
jurisdictional matters (probably because of the infrequency of real disputes on the issue). where the issue has
arisen, the reviewing body has noted the need to examine various criteria primarily of an economic nature. dot
believes that, in most cases, the formal ferc forum can better receive and evaluate the type of information that is
needed to make decisions of this nature than can dot.

in delineating which liquid pipeline facilities are interstate pipeline facilities within the meaning of the hlpsa, dot
will generally rely on the ferc filings; that is, if there is a tariff or concurrence filed with ferc governing the
transportation of hazardous liquids over a pipeline facility or if there has been an exemption from the obligation to
file tariffs obtained from ferc, then dot will, as a general rule, consider the facility to be an interstate pipeline
facility within the meaning of the hlpsa. the types of situations in which dot will ignore the existence or non-
existence of a filing with ferc will be limited to those cases in which it appears obvious that a complaint filed with
ferc would be successful or in which blind reliance on a ferc filing would result in a situation clearly not intended
by the hlpsa such as a pipeline facility not being subject to either state or federal safety regulation. dot
anticipates that the situations in which there is any question about the validity of the ferc filings as a ready
reference will be few and that the actual variations from reliance on those filings will be rare. the following
examples indicate the types of facilities which dot believes are interstate pipeline facilities subject to the hlpsa
despite the lack of a filing with ferc and the types of facilities over which dot will generally defer to the jurisdiction
of a certifying state despite the existence of a filing with ferc.
example 1.
pipeline company p operates a pipeline from “point a” located in state x to “point b” (also in
x). the physical facilities never cross a state line and do not connect with any other pipeline which does
cross a state line. pipeline company p also operates another pipeline between “point c” in state x and
“point d” in an adjoining state y. pipeline company p files a tariff with ferc for transportation from “point
a” to “point b” as well as for transportation from “point c” to “point d.” dot will ignore filing for the line
from “point a” to “point b” and consider the line to be intrastate.
example 2.
same as in example 1 except that p does not file any tariffs with ferc. dot will assume
jurisdiction of the line between “point c” and “point d.”
example 3.
same as in example 1 except that p files its tariff for the line between “point c” and “point d”
not only with ferc but also with state x. dot will rely on the ferc filing as indication of interstate
commerce.
example 4.
same as in example 1 except that the pipeline from “point a” to “point b” (in state x)
connects with a pipeline operated by another company transports liquid between “point b” (in state x) and
“point d” (in state y). dot will rely on the ferc filing as indication of interstate commerce.
example 5.
same as in example 1 except that the line between “point c” and “point d” has a lateral line
connected to it. the lateral is located entirely with state x. dot will rely on the existence or non-existence
of a ferc filing covering transportation over that lateral as determinative of interstate commerce.
example 6.
same as in example 1 except that the certified agency in state x has brought an enforcement
action (under the pipeline safety laws) against p because of its operation of the line between “point a” and
“point b”. p has successfully defended against the action on jurisdictional grounds. dot will assume
jurisdiction if necessary to avoid the anomaly of a pipeline subject to neither state or federal safety
enforcement. dot's assertion of jurisdiction in such a case would be based on the gap in the state's
enforcement authority rather than a dot decision that the pipeline is an interstate pipeline facility.

example 7.
pipeline company p operates a pipeline that originates on the outer continental shelf. p does
not file any tariff for that line with ferc. dot will consider the pipeline to be an interstate pipeline facility.
example 8.
pipeline company p is constructing a pipeline from “point c” (in state x) to “point d” (in state
y). dot will consider the pipeline to be an interstate pipeline facility.
example 9.
pipeline company p is constructing a pipeline from “point c” to “point e” (both in state x) but
intends to file tariffs with ferc in the transportation of hazardous liquid in interstate commerce. assuming
there is some connection to an interstate pipeline facility, dot will consider this line to be an interstate
pipeline facility.
example 10.
pipeline company p has operated a pipeline subject to ferc economic regulation. solely
because of some statutory economic deregulation, that pipeline is no longer regulated by ferc. dot will
continue to consider that pipeline to be an interstate pipeline facility.
as seen from the examples, the types of situations in which dot will not defer to the ferc regulatory scheme are
generally clear-cut cases. for the remainder of the situations where variation from the ferc scheme would require
dot to replicate the forum already provided by ferc and to consider economic factors better left to that agency,
dot will decline to vary its reliance on the ferc filings unless, of course, not doing so would result in situations
clearly not intended by the hlpsa.

appendix b to part 195—risk-based alternative to pressure testing older hazardous liquid and
carbon dioxide pipelines
risk-based alternative
this appendix provides guidance on how a risk-based alternative to pressure testing older hazardous liquid and
carbon dioxide pipelines rule allowed by § 195.303 will work. this risk-based alternative establishes test priorities
for older pipelines, not previously pressure tested, based on the inherent risk of a given pipeline segment. the first
step is to determine the classification based on the type of pipe or on the pipeline segment's proximity to populated
or environmentally sensitive area. secondly, the classifications must be adjusted based on the pipeline failure
history, product transported, and the release volume potential.
tables 2-6 give definitions of risk classification a, b, and c facilities. for the purposes of this rule, pipeline segments
containing high risk electric resistance-welded pipe (erw pipe) and lapwelded pipe manufactured prior to 1970 and
considered a risk classification c or b facility shall be treated as the top priority for testing because of the higher
risk associated with the susceptibility of this pipe to longitudinal seam failures.
in all cases, operators shall annually, at intervals not to exceed 15 months, review their facilities to reassess the
classification and shall take appropriate action within two years or operate the pipeline system at a lower pressure.
pipeline failures, changes in the characteristics of the pipeline route, or changes in service should all trigger a
reassessment of the originally classification.

table 1 explains different levels of test requirements depending on the inherent risk of a given pipeline segment.
the overall risk classification is determined based on the type of pipe involved, the facility's location, the product
transported, the relative volume of flow and pipeline failure history as determined from tables 2-6.

2 all pre-1970 erw pipeline segments may not require testing. in determining which erw pipeline
segments should be included in this category, an operator must consider the seam-related leak history
of the pipe and pipe manufacturing information as available, which may include the pipe steel's
mechanical properties, including fracture toughness; the manufacturing process and controls related
to seam properties, including whether the erw process was high-frequency or low-frequency, whether
the weld seam was heat treated, whether the seam was inspected, the test pressure and duration
during mill hydrotest; the quality control of the steel-making process; and other factors pertinent to
seam properties and quality.
3 for those pipeline operators with extensive mileage of pre-1970 erw pipe, any waiver requests for
timing relief should be supported by an assessment of hazards in accordance with location, product,
volume, and probability of failure considerations consistent with tables 3, 4, 5, and 6.
4 a magnetic flux leakage or ultrasonic internal inspection survey may be utilized as an alternative to
pressure testing where leak history and operating experience do not indicate leaks caused by
longitudinal cracks or seam failures.

vaporize rapidly.

using location, product, volume, and failure history “indicators” from tables 3, 4, 5, and 6 respectively, the
overall risk classification of a given pipeline or pipeline segment can be established from table 2. the location
indicator is the primary factor which determines overall risk, with the product, volume, and probability of
failure indicators used to adjust to a higher or lower overall risk classification per the following table.

appendix c to part 195—guidance for implementation of an integrity management program
this appendix gives guidance to help an operator implement the requirements of the integrity management
program rule in §§ 195.450 and 195.452. guidance is provided on:
(1)
information an operator may use to identify a high consequence area and factors an operator can use to
consider the potential impacts of a release on an area;
(2)
risk factors an operator can use to determine an integrity assessment schedule;
(3)
safety risk indicator tables for leak history, volume or line size, age of pipeline, and product transported, an
operator may use to determine if a pipeline segment falls into a high, medium or low risk category;
(4)
types of internal inspection tools an operator could use to find pipeline anomalies;
(5)
measures an operator could use to measure an integrity management program's performance; and
(6)
types of records an operator will have to maintain.
(7)
types of conditions that an integrity assessment may identify that an operator should include in its
required schedule for evaluation and remediation.
i.
identifying a high consequence area and factors for considering a pipeline segment's potential
impact on a high consequence area.
a.
the rule defines a high consequence area as a high population area, an other populated area,
an unusually sensitive area, or a commercially navigable waterway. the office of pipeline
safety (ops) will map these areas on the national pipeline mapping system (npms). an
operator, member of the public or other government agency may view and download the data
from the npms home page http://www.npms.phmsa.gov/. ops will maintain the npms and
update it periodically. however, it is an operator's responsibility to ensure that it has identified
all high consequence areas that could be affected by a pipeline segment. an operator is also
responsible for periodically evaluating its pipeline segments to look for population or
environmental changes that may have occurred around the pipeline and to keep its program
current with this information. (refer to § 195.452(d)(3).)
(1)
digital data on populated areas available on u.s. census bureau maps.
(2)
geographic database on the commercial navigable waterways available on
http://www.bts.gov/gis/ntatlas/networks.html.
(3)
the bureau of transportation statistics database that includes commercially navigable
waterways and non-commercially navigable waterways. the database can be downloaded
from the bts website at http://www.bts.gov/gis/ntatlas/networks.html.
b.
the rule requires an operator to include a process in its program for identifying which pipeline
segments could affect a high consequence area and to take measures to prevent and mitigate
the consequences of a pipeline failure that could affect a high consequence area. (see §§
195.452 (f) and (i).) thus, an operator will need to consider how each pipeline segment could
affect a high consequence area. the primary source for the listed risk factors is a us dot study
on instrumented internal inspection devices (november 1992). other sources include the
national transportation safety board, the environmental protection agency and the technical
hazardous liquid pipeline safety standards committee. the following list provides guidance to
an operator on both the mandatory and additional factors:

49 cfr appendix-c-to-part-195(7)i.b. (enhanced display)
page 115 of 123

(1)
terrain surrounding the pipeline. an operator should consider the contour of the land
profile and if it could allow the liquid from a release to enter a high consequence area. an
operator can get this information from topographical maps such as u.s. geological survey
quadrangle maps.
(2)
drainage systems such as small streams and other smaller waterways that could serve as
a conduit to a high consequence area.
(3)
crossing of farm tile fields. an operator should consider the possibility of a spillage in the
field following the drain tile into a waterway.
(4)
crossing of roadways with ditches along the side. the ditches could carry a spillage to a
waterway.
(5)
the nature and characteristics of the product the pipeline is transporting (refined products,
crude oils, highly volatile liquids, etc.) highly volatile liquids becomes gaseous when
exposed to the atmosphere. a spillage could create a vapor cloud that could settle into the
lower elevation of the ground profile.
(6)
physical support of the pipeline segment such as by a cable suspension bridge. an
operator should look for stress indicators on the pipeline (strained supports, inadequate
support at towers), atmospheric corrosion, vandalism, and other obvious signs of
improper maintenance.
(7)
operating conditions of the pipeline (pressure, flow rate, etc.). exposure of the pipeline to
an operating pressure exceeding the established maximum operating pressure.
(8)
the hydraulic gradient of the pipeline.
(9)
the diameter of the pipeline, the potential release volume, and the distance between the
isolation points.
(10) potential physical pathways between the pipeline and the high consequence area.
(11) response capability (time to respond, nature of response).
(12) potential natural forces inherent in the area (flood zones, earthquakes, subsidence areas,
etc.)
ii.
risk factors for establishing frequency of assessment.
a.
by assigning weights or values to the risk factors, and using the risk indicator tables, an
operator can determine the priority for assessing pipeline segments, beginning with those
segments that are of highest risk, that have not previously been assessed. this list provides
some guidance on some of the risk factors to consider (see § 195.452(e)). an operator should
also develop factors specific to each pipeline segment it is assessing, including:
(1)
populated areas, unusually sensitive environmental areas, national fish hatcheries,
commercially navigable waters, areas where people congregate.
(2)
results from previous testing/inspection. (see § 195.452(h).)
(3)
leak history. (see leak history risk table.)
(4)
known corrosion or condition of pipeline. (see § 195.452(g).)

(5)
cathodic protection history.
(6)
type and quality of pipe coating (disbonded coating results in corrosion).
(7)
age of pipe (older pipe shows more corrosion—may be uncoated or have an ineffective
coating) and type of pipe seam. (see age of pipe risk table.)
(8)
product transported (highly volatile, highly flammable and toxic liquids present a greater
threat for both people and the environment) (see product transported risk table.)
(9)
pipe wall thickness (thicker walls give a better safety margin)
(10) size of pipe (higher volume release if the pipe ruptures).
(11) location related to potential ground movement (e.g., seismic faults, rock quarries, and
coal mines); climatic (permafrost causes settlement—alaska); geologic (landslides or
subsidence).
(12) security of throughput (effects on customers if there is failure requiring shutdown).
(13) time since the last internal inspection/pressure testing.
(14) with respect to previously discovered defects/anomalies, the type, growth rate, and size.
(15) operating stress levels in the pipeline.
(16) location of the pipeline segment as it relates to the ability of the operator to detect and
respond to a leak. (e.g., pipelines deep underground, or in locations that make leak
detection difficult without specific sectional monitoring and/or significantly impede
access for spill response or any other purpose).
(17) physical support of the segment such as by a cable suspension bridge.
(18) non-standard or other than recognized industry practice on pipeline installation (e.g.,
horizontal directional drilling).
b.
example: this example illustrates a hypothetical model used to establish an integrity
assessment schedule for a hypothetical pipeline segment. after we determine the risk factors
applicable to the pipeline segment, we then assign values or numbers to each factor, such as,
high (5), moderate (3), or low (1). we can determine an overall risk classification (a, b, c) for the
segment using the risk tables and a sliding scale (values 5 to 1) for risk factors for which tables
are not provided. we would classify a segment as c if it fell above 2⁄3 of maximum value
(highest overall risk value for any one segment when compared with other segments of a
pipeline), a segment as b if it fell between 1⁄3 to 2⁄3 of maximum value, and the remaining
segments as a.
i.
for the baseline assessment schedule, we would plan to assess 50% of all pipeline
segments covered by the rule, beginning with the highest risk segments, within the first
31⁄2 years and the remaining segments within the seven-year period. for the continuing
integrity assessments, we would plan to assess the c segments within the first two (2)
years of the schedule, the segments classified as moderate risk no later than year three or
four and the remaining lowest risk segments no later than year five (5).

ii.
for our hypothetical pipeline segment, we have chosen the following risk factors and
obtained risk factor values from the appropriate table. the values assigned to the risk
factors are for illustration only.
age of pipeline: assume 30 years old (refer to “age of pipeline” risk table)—
risk value = 5
pressure tested: tested once during construction—
risk value = 5
coated: (yes/no)—yes
coating condition: recent excavation of suspected areas showed holidays in coating
(potential corrosion risk)—
risk value = 5
cathodically protected: (yes/no)—yes—risk value = 1
date cathodic protection installed: five years after pipeline was constructed (cathodic
protection installed within one year of the pipeline's construction is generally
considered low risk.)—risk value = 3
close interval survey: (yes/no)—no—risk value = 5
internal inspection tool used: (yes/no)—yes. date of pig run? in last five years—risk value =
1
anomalies found: (yes/no)—yes, but do not pose an immediate safety risk or environmental
hazard—risk value = 3
leak history: yes, one spill in last 10 years. (refer to “leak history” risk table)—risk value =
2
product transported: diesel fuel. product low risk. (refer to “product” risk table)—risk value
= 1
pipe size: 16 inches. size presents moderate risk (refer to “line size” risk table)—risk value
= 3
iii.
overall risk value for this hypothetical segment of pipe is 34. assume we have two other
pipeline segments for which we conduct similar risk rankings. the second pipeline
segment has an overall risk value of 20, and the third segment, 11. for the baseline
assessment we would establish a schedule where we assess the first segment (highest
risk segment) within two years, the second segment within five years and the third
segment within seven years. similarly, for the continuing integrity assessment, we could
establish an assessment schedule where we assess the highest risk segment no later
than the second year, the second segment no later than the third year, and the third
segment no later than the fifth year.

iv.
types of internal inspection tools to use.
an operator should consider at least two types of internal inspection tools for the integrity
assessment from the following list. the type of tool or tools an operator selects will depend on the
results from previous internal inspection runs, information analysis and risk factors specific to the
pipeline segment:
(1)
geometry internal inspection tools for detecting changes to ovality, e.g., bends, dents, buckles
or wrinkles, due to construction flaws or soil movement, or other outside force damage;
(2)
metal loss tools (ultrasonic and magnetic flux leakage) for determining pipe wall anomalies,
e.g., wall loss due to corrosion.
(3)
crack detection tools for detecting cracks and crack-like features, e.g., stress corrosion
cracking (scc), fatigue cracks, narrow axial corrosion, toe cracks, hook cracks, etc.

methods to measure performance.

(1)
this guidance is to help an operator establish measures to evaluate the effectiveness of
its integrity management program. the performance measures required will depend on
the details of each integrity management program and will be based on an understanding
and analysis of the failure mechanisms or threats to integrity of each pipeline segment.
(2)
an operator should select a set of measurements to judge how well its program is
performing. an operator's objectives for its program are to ensure public safety, prevent or
minimize leaks and spills and prevent property and environmental damage. a typical
integrity management program will be an ongoing program and it may contain many
elements. therefore, several performance measure are likely to be needed to measure the
effectiveness of an ongoing program.
b.
performance measures. these measures show how a program to control risk on pipeline
segments that could affect a high consequence area is progressing under the integrity
management requirements. performance measures generally fall into three categories:
(1)
selected activity measures—measures that monitor the surveillance and preventive
activities the operator has implemented. these measure indicate how well an operator is
implementing the various elements of its integrity management program.
(2)
deterioration measures—operation and maintenance trends that indicate when the
integrity of the system is weakening despite preventive measures. this category of
performance measure may indicate that the system condition is deteriorating despite well
executed preventive activities.
(3)
failure measures—leak history, incident response, product loss, etc. these measures will
indicate progress towards fewer spills and less damage.
c.
internal vs. external comparisons. these comparisons show how a pipeline segment that could
affect a high consequence area is progressing in comparison to the operator's other pipeline
segments that are not covered by the integrity management requirements and how that
pipeline segment compares to other operators' pipeline segments.
(1)
internal—comparing data from the pipeline segment that could affect the high
consequence area with data from pipeline segments in other areas of the system may
indicate the effects from the attention given to the high consequence area.
(2)
external—comparing data external to the pipeline segment (e.g., ops incident data) may
provide measures on the frequency and size of leaks in relation to other companies.
d.
examples. some examples of performance measures an operator could use include—
(1)
a performance measurement goal to reduce the total volume from unintended releases by
-% (percent to be determined by operator) with an ultimate goal of zero.
(2)
a performance measurement goal to reduce the total number of unintended releases
(based on a threshold of 5 gallons) by ____-% (percent to be determined by operator) with
an ultimate goal of zero.
(3)
a performance measurement goal to document the percentage of integrity management
activities completed during the calendar year.
(4)
a performance measurement goal to track and evaluate the effectiveness of the operator's
community outreach activities.

(5)
a narrative description of pipeline system integrity, including a summary of performance
improvements, both qualitative and quantitative, to an operator's integrity management
program prepared periodically.
(6)
a performance measure based on internal audits of the operator's pipeline system per 49
cfr part 195.
(7)
a performance measure based on external audits of the operator's pipeline system per 49
cfr part 195.
(8)
a performance measure based on operational events (for example: relief occurrences,
unplanned valve closure, scada outages, etc.) that have the potential to adversely affect
pipeline integrity.
(9)
a performance measure to demonstrate that the operator's integrity management program
reduces risk over time with a focus on high risk items.
(10) a performance measure to demonstrate that the operator's integrity management program
for pipeline stations and terminals reduces risk over time with a focus on high risk items.
vi.
examples of types of records an operator must maintain.
the rule requires an operator to maintain certain records. (see § 195.452(l)). this section provides
examples of some records that an operator would have to maintain for inspection to comply with the
requirement. this is not an exhaustive list.
(1)
a process for identifying which pipelines could affect a high consequence area and a document
identifying all pipeline segments that could affect a high consequence area;
(2)
a plan for baseline assessment of the line pipe that includes each required plan element;
(3)
modifications to the baseline plan and reasons for the modification;
(4)
use of and support for an alternative practice;
(5)
a framework addressing each required element of the integrity management program, updates
and changes to the initial framework and eventual program;
(6)
a process for identifying a new high consequence area and incorporating it into the baseline
plan, particularly, a process for identifying population changes around a pipeline segment;
(7)
an explanation of methods selected to assess the integrity of line pipe;
(8)
a process for review of integrity assessment results and data analysis by a person qualified to
evaluate the results and data;
(9)
the process and risk factors for determining the baseline assessment interval;
(10) results of the baseline integrity assessment;
(11) the process used for continual evaluation, and risk factors used for determining the frequency
of evaluation;
(12) process for integrating and analyzing information about the integrity of a pipeline, information
and data used for the information analysis;
(13) results of the information analyses and periodic evaluations;

vii. conditions that may impair a pipeline's integrity.
section 195.452(h) requires an operator to evaluate and remediate all pipeline integrity issues raised
by the integrity assessment or information analysis. an operator must develop a schedule that
prioritizes conditions discovered on the pipeline for evaluation and remediation. the following are
some examples of conditions that an operator should schedule for evaluation and remediation.
a.
any change since the previous assessment.
b.
mechanical damage that is located on the top side of the pipe.
c.
an anomaly abrupt in nature.
d.
an anomaly longitudinal in orientation.
e.
an anomaly over a large area.
f.
an anomaly located in or near a casing, a crossing of another pipeline, or an area with suspect
cathodic protection.
