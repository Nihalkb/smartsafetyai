or 5 percent of all lengths, whichever is greater, need be measured. The thickness of the lengths that are
not measured must be verified by applying a gage set to the minimum thickness found by the
measurement. The nominal wall thickness to be used is the next wall thickness found in commercial
specifications that is below the average of all the measurements taken. However, the nominal wall
thickness may not be more 

elow the average of all the measurements taken. However, the nominal wall
thickness may not be more than 1.14 times the smallest measurement taken on pipe that is less than 20

§ 195.418 Valves: Onshore valve shut-off for rupture mitigation.
(a)
As used in this part, a notification of potential rupture means the notification to, or observation by, an
operator (e.g., by or to its controller(s) in a control room, field personnel, nearby pipeline or utility
personnel, the public, local responders, or public authorities) of one or 

earby pipeline or utility
personnel, the public, local responders, or public authorities) of one or more of the below indicia of a
potential unintentional or uncontrolled release of a large volume of hazardous liquids or carbon dioxide
from a pipeline:
(1)
An unanticipated or unexplained pressure loss outside of the pipeline's normal operating pressures,
as defined in the operator's written procedures. The operator must establish in its written procedures
that an unanticipated or unplanned press

ures. The operator must establish in its written procedures
that an unanticipated or unplanned pressure loss is outside of the pipeline's normal operating
pressures when there is a pressure loss greater than 10 percent occurring within a time interval of
15 minutes or less, unless the operator has documented in its written procedures the operational
need for a greater pressure-change threshold due to pipeline flow dynamics (including changes in
operating pressure, flow rate, or volume), that are

 to pipeline flow dynamics (including changes in
operating pressure, flow rate, or volume), that are caused by fluctuations in product demand,
receipts, or deliveries;
(2)
An unanticipated or unexplained flow rate change, pressure change, equipment function, or other
pipeline instrumentation indication at the upstream or downstream station that may be
representative of an event meeting paragraph (a)(1) of this section; or
(3)
Any unanticipated or unexplained rapid release of a large volume of ha

a)(1) of this section; or
(3)
Any unanticipated or unexplained rapid release of a large volume of hazardous liquid or carbon
dioxide, a fire, or an explosion, in the immediate vicinity of the pipeline.
(b)
A notification of potential rupture occurs when an operator first receives notice of or observes an event
specified in paragraph (a) of this section.
(c)
The requirements of this section do not apply to gathering lines.
(a)
Applicability. For newly constructed and entirely replaced onshore haz

apply to gathering lines.
(a)
Applicability. For newly constructed and entirely replaced onshore hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide
pipeline segments, as defined at § 195.2, with diameters of 6 inches or greater that could affect high-
consequence areas or are located in high consequence areas (HCA), and that have been installed after
April 10, 2023, an operator must install or use existing rupture-mitigation valves (RMV), as defined at §
195.2, or alternative equivalent technologies according t

e-mitigation valves (RMV), as defined at §
195.2, or alternative equivalent technologies according to the requirements of this section and § 195.419.
RMVs and alternative equivalent technologies must be operational within 14 days of placing the new or
replaced pipeline segment in service. An operator may request an extension of this 14-day operation
requirement if it can demonstrate to PHMSA, in accordance with the notification procedures in § 195.18,
that application of that requirement would b

ccordance with the notification procedures in § 195.18,
that application of that requirement would be economically, technically, or operationally infeasible. The
requirements of this section apply to all applicable pipe replacements, even those that do not otherwise
directly involve the addition or replacement of a valve.
(b)
Maximum spacing between valves. RMVs and alternative equivalent technology must be installed in
accordance with the following requirements:
(1)
Shut-off Segment. For purpos

gy must be installed in
accordance with the following requirements:
(1)
Shut-off Segment. For purposes of this section, a “shut-off segment” means the segment of pipeline
located between the upstream valve closest to the upstream endpoint of the replaced pipeline
segment in the HCA or the pipeline segment that could affect an HCA and the downstream valve
closest to the downstream endpoint of the replaced pipeline segment of the HCA or the pipeline

segment that could affect an HCA so that the entirety of the segment that could affect the HCA or
the segment within the HCA is between at least two RMVs or alternative equivalent technologies. If
any crossover or lateral pipe for commodity receipts or deliveries connects to the replaced segment
between the upstream and downstream valves, the shut-off segment also extends to a valve on the
crossover connection(s) or lateral(s), such that, when all valves are closed, there is no flow path for
com

er connection(s) or lateral(s), such that, when all valves are closed, there is no flow path for
commodity to be transported to the rupture site (except for residual liquids already in the shut-off
segment). Multiple segments that could affect HCAs or are in HCAs may be contained within a
single shut-off segment. All entirely replaced onshore hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide pipeline
segments, as defined in § 195.2, that could affect or are in an HCA must include a minimum of one
valve that me

s defined in § 195.2, that could affect or are in an HCA must include a minimum of one
valve that meets the requirements of this section and section 195.419. The operator is not required
to select the closest valve to the shut-off segment as the RMV or alternative equivalent technology.
An operator may use a manual pump station valve at a continuously manned station as an
alternative equivalent technology. Such a manual valve used as an alternative equivalent technology
would not require a notif

chnology. Such a manual valve used as an alternative equivalent technology
would not require a notification to PHMSA in accordance with § 195.18.
(2)
Shut-off segment valve spacing. Pipeline segments subject to paragraph (a) of this section must be
protected on the upstream and downstream side with RMVs or alternative equivalent technologies.
The distance between RMVs or alternative equivalent technologies must not exceed:
(i)
For pipeline segments carrying non-highly volatile liquids (HVL): 15 

hnologies must not exceed:
(i)
For pipeline segments carrying non-highly volatile liquids (HVL): 15 miles, with a maximum
distance not to exceed 71⁄2 miles from the endpoints of a shut-off segment: or
(ii)
For pipeline segments carrying HVLs: 71⁄2 miles. The maximum valve spacing intervals for
these valves may be increased by 1.25 times the spacing distance, up to a 93⁄8-mile spacing at
an endpoint, provided the operator notify PHMSA in accordance with § 195.260 (g).
(3)
Laterals. Laterals exten

t, provided the operator notify PHMSA in accordance with § 195.260 (g).
(3)
Laterals. Laterals extending from shut-off segments that contribute less than 5 percent of the total
shut-off segment volume may have RMVs or alternative equivalent technologies that meet the
actuation requirements of this section at locations other than mainline receipt/delivery points, as
long as all of these laterals contributing hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide volumes to the shut-off
segment do not contribute more

ntributing hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide volumes to the shut-off
segment do not contribute more than 5 percent of the total shut-off segment volume, based upon
maximum flow volume at the operating pressure. A check valve may be used as an alternative
equivalent technology where it is positioned to stop flow into the lateral. Check valves used as an
alternative equivalent technology in accordance with this paragraph (b)(3) are not subject to §
195.419 but must be inspected, operated, and rem

nce with this paragraph (b)(3) are not subject to §
195.419 but must be inspected, operated, and remediated in accordance with § 195.420, including
for closure and leakage, to ensure operational reliability. An operator using such a valve as an
alternative equivalent technology must submit a request to PHMSA in accordance with § 195.18.
(4)
Crossovers. An operator may use a manual valve as an alternative equivalent technology for a
crossover connection if, during normal operations, the valve is 

rnative equivalent technology for a
crossover connection if, during normal operations, the valve is closed to prevent the flow of
hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide with a locking device or other means designed to prevent the
opening of the valve by persons other than those authorized by the operator. The operator must
document that the valve has been closed and locked in accordance with the operator's lock-out and
tag-out procedures to prevent the flow of hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide. An 

tor's lock-out and
tag-out procedures to prevent the flow of hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide. An operator using a
such a valve as an alternative equivalent technology must submit a request to PHMSA in accordance

§ 195.420 Valve maintenance.
(f)
Flow modeling for automatic shut-off valves. Prior to using an ASV as an RMV, the operator must conduct
flow modeling for the shut-off segment and any laterals that feed the shut-off segment, so that the valve
will close within 30 minutes or less following rupture identification, consistent with the operator's
procedures, and in accordance with § 195.2 and this sect

ntification, consistent with the operator's
procedures, and in accordance with § 195.2 and this section. The flow modeling must include the
anticipated maximum, normal, or any other flow volumes, pressures, or other operating conditions that
may be encountered during the year, not to exceed a period of 15 months, and it must be modeled for the
flow between the RMVs or alternative equivalent technologies, and any looped pipelines or hazardous
liquid or carbon dioxide receipt tie-ins. If operating

logies, and any looped pipelines or hazardous
liquid or carbon dioxide receipt tie-ins. If operating conditions change that could affect the ASV set
pressures and the 30-minute valve closure time following a notification of potential rupture, as defined at
§ 195.2, an operator must conduct a new flow model and reset the ASV set pressures prior to the next
review for ASV set pressures in accordance with § 195.420. The flow model must include a time/pressure
chart for the segment containing the AS

 with § 195.420. The flow model must include a time/pressure
chart for the segment containing the ASV if a rupture event occurs. An operator must conduct this flow
modeling prior to making flow condition changes in a manner that could render the 30-minute valve
closure time unachievable.

Appendix A to Part 195—Delineation Between Federal and State Jurisdiction—Statement of
Agency Policy and Interpretation
In 1979, Congress enacted comprehensive safety legislation governing the transportation of hazardous liquids by
pipeline, the Hazardous Liquids Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, 49 U.S.C. 2001 et seq. (HLPSA). The HLPSA expanded
the existing statutory authority for safety regulation, which was limited to transportation by common carriers in
interstate and foreign commerce, to transp

which was limited to transportation by common carriers in
interstate and foreign commerce, to transportation through facilities used in or affecting interstate or foreign
commerce. It also added civil penalty, compliance order, and injunctive enforcement authorities to the existing
criminal sanctions. Modeled largely on the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, 49 U.S.C. 1671 et seq. (NGPSA),
the HLPSA provides for a national hazardous liquid pipeline safety program with nationally uniform mi

he HLPSA provides for a national hazardous liquid pipeline safety program with nationally uniform minimal
standards and with enforcement administered through a Federal-State partnership. The HLPSA leaves to exclusive
Federal regulation and enforcement the “interstate pipeline facilities,” those used for the pipeline transportation of
hazardous liquids in interstate or foreign commerce. For the remainder of the pipeline facilities, denominated
“intrastate pipeline facilities,” the HLPSA provides 

ainder of the pipeline facilities, denominated
“intrastate pipeline facilities,” the HLPSA provides that the same Federal regulation and enforcement will apply
unless a State certifies that it will assume those responsibilities. A certified State must adopt the same minimal
standards but may adopt additional more stringent standards so long as they are compatible. Therefore, in States
which participate in the hazardous liquid pipeline safety program through certification, it is necessary to dist

ipate in the hazardous liquid pipeline safety program through certification, it is necessary to distinguish
the interstate from the intrastate pipeline facilities.
In deciding that an administratively practical approach was necessary in distinguishing between interstate and
intrastate liquid pipeline facilities and in determining how best to accomplish this, DOT has logically examined the
approach used in the NGPSA. The NGPSA defines the interstate gas pipeline facilities subject to exclusive Fe

 used in the NGPSA. The NGPSA defines the interstate gas pipeline facilities subject to exclusive Federal
jurisdiction as those subject to the economic regulatory jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(FERC). Experience has proven this approach practical. Unlike the NGPSA however, the HLPSA has no specific
reference to FERC jurisdiction, but instead defines interstate liquid pipeline facilities by the more commonly used
means of specifying the end points of the transportation 

eline facilities by the more commonly used
means of specifying the end points of the transportation involved. For example, the economic regulatory jurisdiction
of FERC over the transportation of both gas and liquids by pipeline is defined in much the same way. In
implementing the HLPSA DOT has sought a practicable means of distinguishing between interstate and intrastate
pipeline facilities that provide the requisite degree of certainty to Federal and State enforcement personnel and to
the regul

rovide the requisite degree of certainty to Federal and State enforcement personnel and to
the regulated entities. DOT intends that this statement of agency policy and interpretation provide that certainty.
In 1981, DOT decided that the inventory of liquid pipeline facilities identified as subject to the jurisdiction of FERC
approximates the HLPSA category of “interstate pipeline facilities.” Administrative use of the FERC inventory has
the added benefit of avoiding the creation of a separate Fe

nistrative use of the FERC inventory has
the added benefit of avoiding the creation of a separate Federal scheme for determination of jurisdiction over the
same regulated entities. DOT recognizes that the FERC inventory is only an approximation and may not be totally
satisfactory without some modification. The difficulties stem from some significant differences in the economic
regulation of liquid and of natural gas pipelines. There is an affirmative assertion of jurisdiction by FERC over
natura

 and of natural gas pipelines. There is an affirmative assertion of jurisdiction by FERC over
natural gas pipelines through the issuance of certificates of public convenience and necessity prior to commencing
operations. With liquid pipelines, there is only a rebuttable presumption of jurisdiction created by the filing by
pipeline operators of tariffs (or concurrences) for movement of liquids through existing facilities. Although FERC
does police the filings for such matters as compliance with t

ugh existing facilities. Although FERC
does police the filings for such matters as compliance with the general duties of common carriers, the question of
jurisdiction is normally only aired upon complaint. While any person, including State or Federal agencies, can avail
themselves of the FERC forum by use of the complaint process, that process has only been rarely used to review
jurisdictional matters (probably because of the infrequency of real disputes on the issue). Where the issue has
arisen

ters (probably because of the infrequency of real disputes on the issue). Where the issue has
arisen, the reviewing body has noted the need to examine various criteria primarily of an economic nature. DOT
believes that, in most cases, the formal FERC forum can better receive and evaluate the type of information that is
needed to make decisions of this nature than can DOT.

In delineating which liquid pipeline facilities are interstate pipeline facilities within the meaning of the HLPSA, DOT
will generally rely on the FERC filings; that is, if there is a tariff or concurrence filed with FERC governing the
transportation of hazardous liquids over a pipeline facility or if there has been an exemption from the obligation to
file tariffs obtained from FERC, then DOT will, as a general rule, consider the facility to be an interstate pipeline
facility within the meaning 

, as a general rule, consider the facility to be an interstate pipeline
facility within the meaning of the HLPSA. The types of situations in which DOT will ignore the existence or non-
existence of a filing with FERC will be limited to those cases in which it appears obvious that a complaint filed with
FERC would be successful or in which blind reliance on a FERC filing would result in a situation clearly not intended
by the HLPSA such as a pipeline facility not being subject to either State or 

 clearly not intended
by the HLPSA such as a pipeline facility not being subject to either State or Federal safety regulation. DOT
anticipates that the situations in which there is any question about the validity of the FERC filings as a ready
reference will be few and that the actual variations from reliance on those filings will be rare. The following
examples indicate the types of facilities which DOT believes are interstate pipeline facilities subject to the HLPSA
despite the lack of a filin

ich DOT believes are interstate pipeline facilities subject to the HLPSA
despite the lack of a filing with FERC and the types of facilities over which DOT will generally defer to the jurisdiction
of a certifying state despite the existence of a filing with FERC.
Example 1.
Pipeline company P operates a pipeline from “Point A” located in State X to “Point B” (also in
X). The physical facilities never cross a state line and do not connect with any other pipeline which does
cross a state line. Pipe

er cross a state line and do not connect with any other pipeline which does
cross a state line. Pipeline company P also operates another pipeline between “Point C” in State X and
“Point D” in an adjoining State Y. Pipeline company P files a tariff with FERC for transportation from “Point
A” to “Point B” as well as for transportation from “Point C” to “Point D.” DOT will ignore filing for the line
from “Point A” to “Point B” and consider the line to be intrastate.
Example 2.
Same as in example 1 

from “Point A” to “Point B” and consider the line to be intrastate.

Example 3.
Same as in example 1 except that P files its tariff for the line between “Point C” and “Point D”

“Point D” (in State Y). DOT will rely on the FERC filing as indication of interstate commerce.
Example 5.
Same as in example 1 except that the line between “Point C” and “Point D” has a lateral line
connected to it. The lateral is located entirely wi

of a FERC filing covering transportation over that lateral as determinative of interstate commerce.

jurisdiction if necessary to avoid the anomaly of a pipeline subject to neither State or Federal safety

enforcement authority rather than a DOT decision that the pipeline is an interstate pipeline facility.

Carbon Dioxide Pipelines
Risk-Based Alternative
T

ive to Pressure Testing Older Hazardous Liquid and
Carbon Dioxide Pipelines
Risk-Based Alternative
This Appendix provides guidance on how a risk-based alternative to pressure testing older hazardous liquid and
carbon dioxide pipelines rule allowed by § 195.303 will work. This risk-based alternative establishes test priorities
for older pipelines, not previously pressure tested, based on the inherent risk of a given pipeline segment. The first
step is to determine the classification based on the 

nt risk of a given pipeline segment. The first
step is to determine the classification based on the type of pipe or on the pipeline segment's proximity to populated
or environmentally sensitive area. Secondly, the classifications must be adjusted based on the pipeline failure
history, product transported, and the release volume potential.
Tables 2-6 give definitions of risk classification A, B, and C facilities. For the purposes of this rule, pipeline segments
containing high risk electric resis

d C facilities. For the purposes of this rule, pipeline segments
containing high risk electric resistance-welded pipe (ERW pipe) and lapwelded pipe manufactured prior to 1970 and
considered a risk classification C or B facility shall be treated as the top priority for testing because of the higher
risk associated with the susceptibility of this pipe to longitudinal seam failures.
In all cases, operators shall annually, at intervals not to exceed 15 months, review their facilities to reassess the

rators shall annually, at intervals not to exceed 15 months, review their facilities to reassess the
classification and shall take appropriate action within two years or operate the pipeline system at a lower pressure.
Pipeline failures, changes in the characteristics of the pipeline route, or changes in service should all trigger a
reassessment of the originally classification.

Table 1 explains different levels of test requirements depending on the inherent risk of a given pipeline segment.
The overall risk classification is determined based on the type of pipe involved, the facility's location, the product
transported, the relative volume of flow and pipeline failure history as determined from Tables 2-6.

I.
Identifying a high consequence area and factors for considering a pipeline segment's potential
impact on a high consequence area.
A.
The rule defines a High Consequence Area as a hi

impact on a high consequence area.
A.
The rule defines a High Consequence Area as a high population area, an other populated area,
an unusually sensitive area, or a commercially navigable waterway. The Office of Pipeline
Safety (OPS) will map these areas on the National Pipeline Mapping System (NPMS). An
operator, member of the public or other government agency may view and download the data
from the NPMS home page http://www.npms.phmsa.gov/. OPS will maintain the NPMS and
update i

the data
from the NPMS home page http://www.npms.phmsa.gov/. OPS will maintain the NPMS and
update it periodically. However, it is an operator's responsibility to ensure that it has identified
all high consequence areas that could be affected by a pipeline segment. An operator is also
responsible for periodically evaluating its pipeline segments to look for population or
environmental changes that may have occurred around the pipeline and to keep its program
current with this information. (Refer

The rule requires an operator to include a process in its program for identifying which pipeline
segments could affect a high consequence area and to take measures to prevent and mitigate
the consequences of a pipeline failure that could affect a high consequence area. (See §§
195.452 (f) and (i).) Thus, an operator will need to consid

 affect a high consequence area. (See §§
195.452 (f) and (i).) Thus, an operator will need to consider how each pipeline segment could
affect a high consequence area. The primary source for the listed risk factors is a US DOT study
on instrumented Internal Inspection devices (November 1992). Other sources include the
National Transportation Safety Board, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Technical
Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Standards Committee. The following list provides guidanc

operator can get this information from topographical maps such as U.S. Geological Survey
quadrangle maps.

Drainage systems such as small streams and other smaller waterways that could serve as
a conduit to a high consequence area.

support at towers), atmospheric corrosion, vandalism, and other obvious signs of
improper maintenance.

 illustrates a hypothetical model used to establish an integrity
assessment schedule for a hypothetical pipeline segment. After we determine the risk factors
applicable to the pipeline segment, we then assign values or numbers to each factor, such as,
high (5), moderate (3), or low (1). We can determine an overall risk classification (A, B, C) for the
segment using the risk tables and a sliding scale (values 5 to 1) for risk factors for which tables
are not provided. We would classify a segment 

ale (values 5 to 1) for risk factors for which tables
are not provided. We would classify a segment as C if it fell above 2⁄3 of maximum value
(highest overall risk value for any one segment when compared with other segments of a
pipeline), a segment as B if it fell between 1⁄3 to 2⁄3 of maximum value, and the remaining
segments as A.

For the baseline assessment schedule, we would plan to assess 50% of all pipeline
segments covered by the rule, beginning with the highest risk segments, within

segments covered by the rule, beginning with the highest risk segments, within the first
31⁄2 years and the remaining segments within the seven-year period. For the continuing
integrity assessments, we would plan to assess the C segments within the first two (2)
years of the schedule, the segments classified as moderate risk no later than year three or
four and the remaining lowest risk segments no later than year five (5).

IV.
Types of internal inspection tools to use.
An operator should consider at least two types of internal inspection tools for the integrity
assessment from the following list. The type of tool or tools an operator selects will depend on the
results from previous internal inspection runs, information analysis and risk f

s will depend on the
results from previous internal inspection runs, information analysis and risk factors specific to the
pipeline segment:
(1)
Geometry Internal inspection tools for detecting changes to ovality, e.g., bends, dents, buckles
or wrinkles, due to construction flaws or soil movement, or other outside force damage;
(2)
Metal Loss Tools (Ultrasonic and Magnetic Flux Leakage) for determining pipe wall anomalies,
e.g., wall loss due to corrosion.
(3)
Crack Detection Tools for detecting

ining pipe wall anomalies,
e.g., wall loss due to corrosion.
(3)
Crack Detection Tools for detecting cracks and crack-like features, e.g., stress corrosion
cracking (SCC), fatigue cracks, narrow axial corrosion, toe cracks, hook cracks, etc.

(1)
This guidance is to help an operator establish measures to evaluate the effectiveness of
its integrity management program. The performance measures required will depend on
the details of each integrity management program and will be based on an understanding
and analysis of the failure mechanisms or threats to integrity of each pipeline segment.
(2)
An operator should select a set of measurements to judge how well its program is
performing. An operator's objectives for its program are to ens

nts to judge how well its program is
performing. An operator's objectives for its program are to ensure public safety, prevent or
minimize leaks and spills and prevent property and environmental damage. A typical
integrity management program will be an ongoing program and it may contain many
elements. Therefore, several performance measure are likely to be needed to measure the
effectiveness of an ongoing program.

B.
Performance measures. These measures show how a program to control risk on pipeline
segments that could affect a high consequence area is progressing under the integrity
management requirements. Performance measures generally fall into three categories:
(1)
Selected Activity Measures—Measures that monitor the surveillance and preventive
activities the operator has implemented. These measure indicate how well an operator is
implementing the various elements of its integrity m

 These measure indicate how well an operator is
implementing the various elements of its integrity management program.
(2)
Deterioration Measures—Operation and maintenance trends that indicate when the
integrity of the system is weakening despite preventive measures. This category of
performance measure may indicate that the system condition is deteriorating despite well
executed preventive activities.
(3)
Failure Measures—Leak History, incident response, product loss, etc. These measures will

Failure Measures—Leak History, incident response, product loss, etc. These measures will
indicate progress towards fewer spills and less damage.
C.
Internal vs. External Comparisons. These comparisons show how a pipeline segment that could
affect a high consequence area is progressing in comparison to the operator's other pipeline
segments that are not covered by the integrity management requirements and how that
pipeline segment compares to other operators' pipeline segments.

Inte

 requirements and how that
pipeline segment compares to other operators' pipeline segments.
(1)
Internal—Comparing data from the pipeline segment that could affect the high
consequence area with data from pipeline segments in other areas of the system may
indicate the effects from the attention given to the high consequence area.
(2)
External—Comparing data external to the pipeline segment (e.g., OPS incident data) may
provide measures on the frequency and size of leaks in relation to other comp

provide measures on the frequency and size of leaks in relation to other companies.
D.
Examples. Some examples of performance measures an operator could use include—
(1)
A performance measurement goal to reduce the total volume from unintended releases by
-% (percent to be determined by operator) with an ultimate goal of zero.
(2)
A performance measurement goal to reduce the total number of unintended releases
(based on a threshold of 5 gallons) by ____-% (percent to be de

 total number of unintended releases
(based on a threshold of 5 gallons) by ____-% (percent to be determined by operator) with
an ultimate goal of zero.
(3)
A performance measurement goal to document the percentage of integrity management
activities completed during the calendar year.
(4)
A performance measurement goal to track and evaluate the effectiveness of the operator's
community outreach activities.
